The restaurant, if you could call it that, was filled with the types of things you would not like to find in an establishment you plan to eat in. Large bugs—mostly centipedes—crisscrossed the floor carrying breadcrumbs, and dreadcrumbs, and whatever else can crumble.  Men were fighting, some small fights with hushed voices and slaps across the table, some big fights where men went flying backwards across the room.  Sprill was in disbelief that his navigators had lead him into such a place.  Hinchcliffe and Dagon were grinning to their ears. 

Dagon liked to tell Sprill of the finer things in life: tea on a winter morning, how to hold your fork when the ladies are watching, which way you tipped your head as you bowed, if you liked someone—which way if you didn’t. His tailored coat was as out of place as and spiral staircase in a single story cottage.  Still, he made no notice of the men staring at him as he thumped his fist on the bar and ordered a round of, “The darkest you got sweetie.  Tip you double if it’s as dark as me.” And he flashed a grin that dropped Sprill’s stomach through the cottage floor. 

“Master Hinchcliffe,” said Sprill, “I don’t think this is a place we want to stay long.”

Hinchcliffe took a deep breath, drawing in the smell, “That my good friend is something I’ll agree with.  This is a place I’d like to stay forever.”  

Sprill stared slack jawed as the navigators, who hated each other six days a week, spent their seventh bumping shoulders and cheering drinks at the bar.   

“Weird isn’t it?” Said Carmichael, appearing at his shoulder.

“Indeed,” said Sprill, happy to have someone agree with him. 

“You’d think they would have ordered wine.” And Carmichael push through the crowd to the bar with his hand waving high.

And Sprill’s jaw fell further to his chest. 

The rest of the crew drank long and hard and Sprill sat alone at his table waiting for them to be done.  He thought they were coming for a key, but he’d learned that the key was not here yet, and there was no sense in staying sober while they waited.   He was about to give up and wait back at the inn when a pair of familiar unlaced boots entered. 

“My worthless companions and undesirable losers!” Shouted Geraldo, holding his arms up high.  Heads turned, voices stopped, there was time for a fork to drop and clatter in the silence. Sprill worried his thumbs. “The next rounds on me!” A chorus, loud enough to give Sprill a migraine, thundered thought the low ceiling and smoke. Sprill took a sip of his water and lime, he didn’t want scurvy if he could avoid it. 

It wasn’t long before Geraldo took the table beside Sprill and had it loaded with dark bottles of rum and hunks of fresh bread that were noisily being dipped in gravy. 

Sprill made a few awkward waves with his hand.  *Hi there, no? Just kidding* And he’d slick back his sun burnt hair.  He should say something.  Geraldo would be happy to see him. Sprill ordered a shot, sipped it, remembered he hated it, and put down the rest of the dirty rum. 

“Geraldo!” He said, trying to casually laugh, but ending up in a spurt of coughing. 

Geraldo squinted and pulled dirty hair out of his face, “Who be that?”
“Looks like a right proper lad,” said a large man with a shoulder tattoo of a dragon. 

“Cant be speaking to them now can we,” said Geraldo. 

“No sir,” said the thin first mate with the snake tattooed around his lips that Sprill remembered from the bay. “This proper lad might need to go back to his proper place.” 

“Good call Jerry, can’t be caught up in the propriety!” He sucked down a drink of beer that would have sent Sprill’s stomach to spirals. 

“Geraldo!” Said Sprill, determined, “It’s me!  Captain Sprill!” 

“Sprill? Like Quill?”

“We know eachother.  Back from Portsmouth.”
“Portsmouth!” Said Geraldo, with a grin.  Sprill felt relieved, happy to be recognized.  “A pleasant town,” said Geraldo, “Filled with many nice foods and many angry women.  You’ve been?”
Sprill gave up and sank back into his booth red faced and lonely. He didn’t know why Geraldo was pretending not to know him, but he thought some rum might help him find out. 

“Two shots!” Shouted Sprill.
