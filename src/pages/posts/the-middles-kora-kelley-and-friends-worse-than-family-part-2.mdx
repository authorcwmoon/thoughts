Mrs. Maybelle lived, or rather existed since Timmy had disappeared, in a tiny red house with blue shingles.  It was as tacky as the “Save the Whales” bumper sticker on her Prius. Her garden used to be famous, but she’d let the weeds grow over the petunias, the daisys wither, and the tomatoes starve. Even the rocks seemed underfed. 

Oz was parked outside in the driveway. His rusted Dodge truck idled blowing exhaust up into the night sky. 

Kora was lucky she hadn’t been pulled over as she chased Oz's truck through the streets.  She’d picked the foil out of her hair and dropped it on the floorboard.  A bottle of old water had been in her cupholder, and she did her best to rinse the dye out of her hair.  More water had ended up on her sweater than in her hair. 

It was cold, and her hair froze in the short walk to Oz’s truck. She rubbed her hands together and used the heater vents as a hair dryer. 

“I’m gonna do it,” said Oz, white knuckles gripping the steering wheel. 

“Are you? Is that why you’re sitting here instead of on the doorstep?” Mistake, Kora knew as soon as she said it.

Oz scrunched his nose, his beard bunching over his lip. He nodded once and ripped open the door.  His boots crunched across the glassy frozen grass in the yard. 

*I have too many friends*, thought Kora as she chased Oz across the yard whispering loudly.

“You don’t have to do this! It’s not that big a deal.  This is not going to help.  It’s a mistake.” 

Oz was knocking. He had always been hard headed and stubborn.  He’d asked her out for a week straight once. A week of flowers and chocolates. She was more of a coffee and whiskey type of woman. 

Mrs. Maybelle opened the door and Kora knew in an instant this was not the time, nor the place, nor even the universe for Oz to be confessing. 

Her eyes were stained with dark circles that were powdered with the red blush of a long night drinking.  She was wearing a full ballgown that could have been worn to a prom. There wasn’t a drink in her hand, but there should have been.  Things would have made more sense that way. 

“Ozzy?” asked Mrs. Maybelle, “Whats wrong?  Come in.”

“I’m afraid I can’t do that ma’am.  I just came to say—“ 

Kora cut him off, “WE came to say we are sorry for your loss.”

“My loss?” Mrs. Maybelle almost wailed, “Did they find him?” She put her hand to her mouth and tears filled her eyes, “Oh the cops didn’t tell me they’d found him.”

*Oh, no. What have I done*, thought Kora, she still thought he was missing. She reached out and touched Mrs. Maybelles, shoulder. “I didn’t mean it like that. I meant the situation.  We haven’t heard anything.”

Mrs. Maybell dried her eyes with her lacy sleeve, “Oh well. I suppose I should expect the worst.  No harm done.”

Oz stamped his foot.  Kora saw his fists were balled and his lip was shaking.  He was wavering, she’d gotten there just in time. 

Well, at least that’s what Kora was thinking before Oz blurted out, “I shot your son Mrs. Maybelle.  I’m sorry about it. There ain’t nothing I can do about it. Thought you should know.” 

It would have been hard to tell who’s jaw was lower. Mrs. Maybelle started gaping like a fish.  O-m-O-m. Kora was fixed in a look of shock. 

There are special moments in life where time slows down, and you think about what your purpose really is.  This was not one of those moments.  In this moment, Kora was thinking about how far and how fast they needed to run before Oz went to jail for murder. Or manslaughter.  Or whatever sort of charge you got when you shoot a kid on your porch. 

The answer would turn out to be much further and much faster than she thought.
