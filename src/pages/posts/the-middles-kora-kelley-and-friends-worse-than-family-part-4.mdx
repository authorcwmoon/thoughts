Kora wasn’t sure what Oz thought would happen.  He probably hadn’t thought past anything besides clearing his conscious.  The problem was Mrs. Maybelle was not the forgiving type.  Despite the flowers and the Welcome Friends mat on her cold concrete step, she was not in a place to share love. 

When Oz explained what had happened—shooting her son in the chest that is—Mrs. Maybelle sat down cross legged and started wailing.  Screams louder than a Cessna engine whined through the rural countryside.  Even the birds were scared in their nests.  Kora watched a pack of songbirds clear the trees. 

When the screaming had finally stopped, which Kora thought would never happen, Mrs. Maybelle stood up, walked to the kitchen, and brought back a knife. 

That’s when Kora finally pulled Oz’s arm hard enough to get him to snap out of it, run back to the truck, put it in reverse, back out of the driveway, and start driving out of town. 

If they would have been thinking rational, they might have gone to the police station and turned themselves in. If they explained the situation, maybe the cops would have listened, dug up the body, and realized it was all a big accident. 

Kora explained all of this to Oz, even though she’d been the one who suggested to bury the body in the first place, “They’ll never believe it was an accident.”  *You shouldn’t have shot him in the back*

“So what do we do Kora!?” shouted Oz as the Dodge pulled onto the highway. He was driving fast and the tires chirped on the frozen asphalt. “I’m not trying to go to jail!”

“I don’t know Oz!” She buried her face in her hands. How was this happening? She was a good person. She went to work on time, recycled, picked up trash when it blew down the street. She even sent in ten cents a month to that child in Africa after she’d watched the infomercial. “I think we should go to the cops. I really do. I was trying to protect Mrs. Maybelle and you, but now all that’s out the window.  You either go to the police or you get the hell outta here.”


Oz was ready to cry, he bit his upper lip chewing his beard. “You think she hates me?”

“I don’t know Oz. What do you think? She seemed really happy with you when she brought the knife out. Probably was going to cut you a piece of cake or something.”

“No. No I was pretty sure she was going to slice me.”

Kora’s jaw hung open but she wasn’t surprised, Oz had always been slow with sarcasm, “Yah I think you’re right about that one champ.” 

The neighboring town exit sign beckoned with the promise of a Casey’s, Taco Bell, and McDonalds. Oz took it so they wouldn’t be spotted on the highway.  They passed the restaurants, and Kora realized she hadn’t eaten. She also realized this was not her problem. 

“I think you should let me out here, Oz.  I love you. But I don’t want to turn into some sort of outlaw.”

“I done thought about that already. Thing is, your prints have to be somewhere on that body.  And good luck explaining that.”

*Damn*

“They still don’t know where the body is.  So as long as you don’t go spilling that then we’re fine.” 

“No, I got a better plan.”

“Let’s here it.”

“Lazarus,” said Oz. 

Kora knew Oz well enough to tell he was serious. She knew the Bible well enough to know what he was talking about. And she knew herself well enough to know that she didn’t just have too many friends, she had too stupid of friends.

“Oh, Jesus Chris, Oz. Do you have some sort of cockbrained resurrection idea?  What are you going to do, find a witch?”

“I figure Wanda could do it.”

Kora held up a hand, “I cannot handle you right now. Come on. Let’s go to my house. If I’m aiding and abetting then I might as well be able to sleep in my bed.”
