When Sprill saw all the other ships in the harbor on the morning he was set to find his secret treasure, his first instinct was to find who had betrayed him. 

This instinct was well warranted, no one had known about the secret treasure map. Except, of course, for his crew. He was going to find out who had spilled the beans. But when he did, he was going to be even more dissapointed than he thought he could be. 

Sprill thought Hinchcliffe and Dagon were surely to blame. He called them up to his position by the wheel. 

“Yessir,” said Hinchcliffe, not nearly as alarmed as Sprill.

“What is this about,” said Dagon, picking the bone of a fish out of his teeth.

“I think it’s abundantly clear what this is about Dagon,” he swept his arm across the harbor, “We’ve been betrayed.” 

Dagon frowned, “And by whom do you think?”

“By one of you gents I believe!”

Hinchcliffe and Dagon shared a knowing look, “Are you going to tell him?” asked Dagon.

“I suppose,” muttered Hinchcliffe, he straightened, “It appears our night out led to a few—how would you say…Slippery tongues,” 

“I can see that,” said Sprill, “But who’s tongue has slipped!?” 

“Yours” coughed Dagon. 

“What’s that?”

“Yours sir,” said Hinchcliffe. 

Sprills eyes buzzed from ship to ship, *He? Captain Sprill who followed the plan to a T? Dotted his lower case j’s. How could he have slipped.*

Dagon said, “I believe the exact words were something like…Oh how did they go Sir Hinchcliffe?”

“Erherm,” Hinchcliffe projected his voice across the deck, “You can never be lost if you know exactly what you’re looking for!” 

It came rushing back to Sprill like an embarrassing memory, for that of course is what it was. The bar, the drinks, the boasting. His mother had told him that alcohol was the work of the Devil. And how easy he had been tempted. What was he to do? He had to get the treasure and get off the island before anyone else found it. “Tell me Hinchcliffe.  Did I say anything about the map?”

“Yessir. A great deal.”

Sprill moaned.  It was going to be a tough race to win.
