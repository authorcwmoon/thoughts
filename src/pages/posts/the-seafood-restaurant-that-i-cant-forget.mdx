If you’re looking for seafood, and I’m talking really good seafood, I tell you that you’re looking in the wrong place my friend. Just because we’re at a lake and there are seashell pillows at the mall doesn’t mean that this is the place to try to order clams. We don’t have us clams here in Missouri and the one’s we do are not the ones you want to eat. 

Which is why I couldn’t stand the face of the sun stroked fat tourist asking about why his clams were rubbery after he called me over to refill his glass of water. “What did you cook these with? A hammer?” He laughs at his own joke. 

I couldn’t tell you the difference between a rubbery clam and a piece of actual rubber. I make $3.25 an hour plus tips from people like you here my guy. I promise I’m never tasting eight hours worth of smelly clams. I oughta tell him that—

“Nathan!” the front of house calls, stopping me from my plan of return fire, “You have another table waiting.”  She points over to a man and woman. The man dressed in all white. The woman in all black. They are cute, not sunburned, and look like they will tip well. 

I tell the fat man I’ll see what the kitchen can do about it, taking the pitcher, still full over to the new table. I hear him yell that I might be forgetting something and I assure him that I don’t think I am. 

With speed and grace I fill the new diners waters to the brim—not to much ice—and tell them how happy I am that they’ve chosen to dine with us at the finest seafood establishment the lake has to offer. If you’re looking for seafood, and I’m talking really good seafood, you’ve come to the right place, I hear myself say. 

The man, blonde, easy-going, with a drawl smiles and says, “If I was looking for seafood, I’d look for the sea first. We’ll take two beers. Cold. Thanks Nathan.” 

I don’t know this couple, definitely not local, we all know each other here “Certainly sir. Have I served you before?”

The couple shared a look. The woman, colder and dry as a bat in winter sipped her water, “Once or twice.” 

Weird folks, I thought, certain I’d never met them before. I asked the bartender to give me two of whatever was cold and expensive. The frosted mugs came out less than frosty and I hoped the couple wouldn’t notice. There’s $15.00. Three dollar tip at least. 

“Might I suggest the clams. They are a popular item tonight.” 

“You really don’t remember us do you?” asked the woman.

“Excuse me?”

“I said—“

The man cut her off, “If he remembered us, he’d know that we would like two burgers please. Rare. Extra ketchup and make sure the fries are crispy.” He shooed me away with a hand and cast a mean stare at the woman. 

I’d seen enough scary movies and read enough time travel books to not let that one slide. 

“How do you know me?”

The woman wanted to say something. Her green eyes screamed a tale of thoughts. I could tell because she held her mouth shut tight but still her vocal chords rumbled, ready to strike. Ready to tell. 

“Ill put your order in while you think about it.” 

I didn’t know these people. I knew I didn’t know these people.  With the quickness, I racked my brain of places they might have known me from: school, chess club, football, it had to be football. Maybe they’d seen my highlight real. As wide a shot that was from possible it still seemed reasonable then when they told me the truth. 

The man was still wining about his rubber clams but I gave him a loaf of bread and said we’d get him some ice cream which settled his temper. But my thoughts were only on the couple. They’d finished their beers and must have come to some sort of agreement because they were both nodding when I came over with their second round. 

“Nathan,” said the woman, “We have some news—“ 

This was it! I’d been discovered, it had to be the highlight reel, I was going to get a scholarship and get the heck out of this fish smelling hell-hole. 

“You’re dead,” she finished. 

“What?” 

“Well, not quite dead,” said the man, “Just in a bit of an alternative reality.” He held his beer up to his eye and tipped it upside down. Nothing spilled, the beer floated, suspended. 

“But. But how?”
 
“You see. You were in an accident. We were able to save part of you.” 

“This part specifically,” the woman in all black spun her finger in a circle pointed toward the ceiling. 

Some things I’d been trying to ignore started to flame up into my vision. The man with the clams. He always ordered the clams. It was Tuesday. It had been Tuesday for weeks. The clams were always on special. 

The waiter from the kitchen slid the burgers and fries into place at the table. Extra ketchup. Crispy. My order. 

The man stood up, “You can keep living here as long as you like. This is all we could salvage.” 

“What do you mean I can stay here.”

“Here, have a bite to eat.” He stood and motioned for me to take his seat. The burger was delicious. Everything I remembered about a good burger. The fries were dark, on the edge of burnt. 

The woman had tears in her eyes. “We’ll be back tomorrow.”

“What do you mean?”  And then the burger was back again. Someone was yelling at me. Yelling about rubbery clams. 

“What did you cook these with?” said the fat man, “A hammer?” And he laughs.
