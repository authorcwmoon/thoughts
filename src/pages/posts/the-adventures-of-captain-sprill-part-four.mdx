There was an island on the horizon.  An island that should not be there according to the map Sprill was holding.  He handed the wheel to Carmichael standing beside him and took out his spyglass his mother had gifted him, *”Quite expensive honey, do be careful with it.  Cost seven shillings at the store.”* With care he extended the telescope and aimed at the island. 

“I’ll say Carmichael, that looks a great deal like—“ He paused, couldn’t be, “Is that Gran Canaria?”  He saw another ship closer to harbor.  It was tacking back and forth like a drunkard. “And Geraldo?” 

He whirred around ready to wring the necks of his navigators. 

“Now before you get angry Captain,” said Dagon, appearing without being summoned, “Master Hinchcliffe and I thought that a small detour might be in our best interest.” 
 
“You’re in on this too!?” 

Hinchcliffe stood sure shouldered as ever, “I may not agree with Dagon all that often, but on this point we are aligned.”

The crew was going about their business pretending not to listen.  Sprill saw their glances when they thought he wasn’t looking. 

“My cabin!  Now.”

Sprill paced back and forth with his hands behind his back.  “This was not the plan.  We had thirteen days to make Morocco. No stops.  Why on God’s blue ocean are we a stones throw away from the Canaries.” 

Hinchcliffe looked sideways at Dagon who was sipping his tea. “Oh, you’re going to make me do it?”

Dagon spoke, “I think it best coming from you.  Age before beauty.”

“Best what!?” Sprill’s face was red and throat was hot. He felt time ticking away before him. 

Hinchcliffe cleared his throat, “There is a certain business matter your father asked us to attend to on our way to Morocco.” 

Sprill narrowed his eyes, “He made no such mention to me.”

“No, indeed he would not!” laughed Dagon. 

“What is the joke. Out with it!” 

“Sir. Captain,” said Hinchcliffe, “Are you familiar with the way your father made his money?”

“He’s a businessman.  A trader.  Runs a successful store filled with nice things that people pay too much money for.  What of it?” 

“What if we were to tell you,” said Dagon, “that may not be true.  And that no one can make that money from—erm—honest dealings.” 

Sprill had the sudden urge to strike Dagon in his puffy cheeks. His fist balled at his sides. His calmer, rational self prevailed. Sprill hated wasting time, hated wasting anything. “Let’s save the bit where you recount my fathers criminal history that he’s hidden lovers and whatever else from me and my mother.” Sprill had read plenty of books, he knew how this would go, “So we’re some sort of pirate family?  Am I picking up a bastard brother?  Breaking someone out of jail?”

Hincliffe and Dagon were staring wide eyed.  Their heads rotating back and forth like owls.

Dagon cleared his throat, “Ehrm—“ he took a sip of tea, “That’s not quite right.  Thing is, there’s a key here we have to pick up—for the treasure site.  It wasn’t to be disclosed for security purposes.” 

Sprill’s face was red, so red he thought it might melt the beard from his cheeks. He said nothing. 

“Yes,” said Hinchcliffe, “A couple keys.  Part of the map details.  They were found in briefing Section Six Part A.”

“Section Six?” asked Sprill, he’d read the brief front ways and back ways and all ways besides sideways, “There is no section six.”

“All parties were not privy to all information,” said Hinchcliffe, with a meaningful look at Dagon, “to prevent mutiny and such.”

Sprill scowled, feeling like the butt of a joke more than a captain.  “So we go to The Canaries,” he said, through gritted teeth. “And where do we find these keys?”

Dagon and Hinchcliffe looked at each other with funny, should we tell him, faces. Hinchcliffe spoke first, “It’s an interesting establishment.”

“Kind of like a bank,” added Dagon.

“But also like a bar,” finished Hinchcliffe. 

Captain Sprill thought he knew what they meant.  So he nodded.  But when he got there, he realized he’d been wrong.  Wrong in many different ways.
