Not small like a baby, but small like an ear corn that has just been plucked from the harvest field.  You could hold her in one had, but if you did, you wouldn’t have that hand for long.  She was the leader of the Little People `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`makiawisug`}</em>{`.  If you fed her bones, she could call the wind and the thunder.  And she carried off the bad children if they didn’t behave-never to be seen again.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Noko had never seen Squannit. She’d tried being bad, she’d tried being good, and she tried leaving baskets of corn in the woods as bait.  And she was trying again today.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`As a child, Noko had aways wanted to meet the gods. If Mashup was big enough to swallow a whale whole, then he couldn’t hide for long.  This morning her search was bright with the low fall sun and clear with a couple clouds in sight—not enough to worry about.  Silent, she tracked small footprints in the mud into the forest and into the fern bushes.  Leaves would have crunched if Noko wasn’t so light footed.  In fact, Noko was so light footed, she had to wear beads on her wrist so she wouldn’t scare her family.  Too many times her father had almost hit her with his knotted walking stick after she surprised him from behind. `}</p>\n    <p>{`A whitetail print was fresh, toes spread like it had been running.  She dipped two fingers into the mud to check the depth.  Heavy, probably male.  The smaller prints she had been following led the opposite way.  Her bow drifted down the path of the deer.  `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`We need more food for the long nights.  Go out and get some today,`}</em>{` her mother’s voice played in her head. `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Unless your father gets a whale.  And we all know how likely that is`}</em>{`. `}</p>\n    <p>{`She frowned thinking about the upcoming events. The white man had invited Massasoit to some sort of party tomorrow.  As much as she loved her Sachem, she didn’t trust his decisions. No one could be sure, but everyone knew that the sickness had come from that boat.  `}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`But you’re not thinking about that are you uncle?`}</em>{` She laughed to herself, an honest laugh, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`All you see is the women.`}</em>{`  She shook her head as she danced through the trees on the trail of Squannit. `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`We have a lot to talk about today, you and me, old woman.`}</em>{`  She needed to ask where the storms were, why the boats weren’t blown out of the harbor, and what she was supposed to do about Metacomet’s wandering eyes. And that other boy-Phillip. Phillip’s eyes spent too much time on mother. No time to think about that now.*`}</p>\n    <p>{`The trail ended in a fern bush below the shadow of a tall pine tree.  Noko knelt and pulled back the leaves slowly.  So slow that nothing would hear her.  So, slow, that—Woosh!\nNoko fell back into the mud.  A rabbit jumped from the underbrush and bounced away deeper into the forest. `}</p>\n    <p>{`She tossed her bow and regretted it.  It had been a gift from her father and she hurried to make sure it wasn’t damaged. “Those were not rabbit tracks,” she said, “They were not at all.”\n“No,” said a deep voice from behind her, “No they were not.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Noko whirled around expecting a man but seeing nothing.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Eyes down,” commanded the voice. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Granny Squannit was small and leathery.  She had a pipe in one hand and a hunk of white bread in the other.  The type the white men had brought with them.  Her moccasins were made from the the brightest orange leather Noko had ever seen. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“You’re real,” said Noko, who despite her faith had started to harbor doubts. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“And you’re nosy.  Why have you come? And why didn’t I hear you coming?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Noko grinned.  She held her foot up and wriggled her toes, “They call me Water Runner.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Ears must be going. Water is loud.  Have you heard a wave?” She shook her head, “Ears and the storms.” Waving her pipe in the air she shouted, “Where are you thunder!” But the sky didn’t answer.  A bored cloud floated above the break in the trees. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“You can’t bring the storms?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Have you tasted this bread?” asked Squannit, ignoring her, “As useless as they are.  Those snow colored woman can bake.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Noko flinched, she had tasted the bread, and it was good.  But she didn’t like that Squannit liked it.  She didn’t like that anyone liked it. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Granny Squannit.  We have a problem.” Noko had planned this moment for a long time and the words came out in a rush, “There is a feast tomorrow and I don’t trust them. Metacomet wants me to be his wife.  He hasn’t told me but I know it.  And there’s a white man, Phillip.” She hadn’t planned this part. Noko scrunched her nose and continued, “He brings illness to the village. Hot drink they call rum.  I caught him staring at mother with greedy eyes.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Squannit didn’t say much. She didn’t say anything at all. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Well?” Asked Noko, “What do I do?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“This is what you come to me for?” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Yes.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“You want my advice?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Yes.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Grow up.  And when you can see your eyes, let go.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`Squannit walked away, through the ferns making it hard for Noko to follow.  “Hey!” said Noko, “I am grown up.  What does that mean?”     `}</p>\n    <p>{`She hunted, pecked, and almost lost Squannit many times. Eventually they came to a clearing where the grass had lain over, and the wind was stirring. Squannit started waving her hands and yelling at the sky. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“You see this!?” shouted Squannit. “This is a problem.”  The sky was bright blue, not a hint of gray.  Noko had been told Squannit could make a cloud split and crack with lightening at the snap of her fingers. This was not what she had expected.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“What’s wrong?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“I traded something for today, for something for tomorrow.”  And Squannit let out a huge burst of smoke from her lungs.  “Thunder for greed.  Thunder for addiction.” said Squannit, through the smoke. “The white men have the thunder sticks, but Ol Squant can’t call it no more.” When the gray cloud cleared, she was gone.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Noko was disappointed that night in the wigwam. She had met her first god and she was anything but helpful.  All she wanted was to meet the gods.  Maybe Mashup would have more advice.  She polished her bow, making sure that the scuff where she’d thrown it was smooth. The scratch was still deep when Phillip entered the through the flap. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“What are you doing here!” shouted Noko, drawing her bow and nocking an arrow before Phillip could think about putting up his hands.  It would not be the last time she drew on Phillip, somehow she knew that. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Phillip squinted and mumbled some words Noko didn’t understand. Her mother, Tatapanunum, came in behind him with slack shoulders. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Easy Water Runner,” said mother. “He’s a guest.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Phillip stayed for too long.  And Noko had to watch him the whole time.  He’d brought with him the bottle of brown fire water that the sailors drank.  Noko spit out her mouthful but her mother drank deep.  Soon she was red in the face and Phillip’s arm was around her.  He seemed to be having visions too, saying strange things with his red chapped lips that disgusted Noko. `}</p>\n    <p>{`He reached out in a flash and tried to grab her ankle.  If he wasn’t confused, or whatever was wrong with him, he would have made it.  She picked up her spear and backed to the corner of her  home. `}</p>\n    <p>{`If her father came home, they all would be dead.  She knew that.  But she couldn’t do anything about it. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Phillip was still there in the morning when Metacomet called from outside.  Noko tied the flap and tied it fast. His faceprint was dark and his cheeks glinted in the early morning sun.  Noko didn’t know if she loved him. But she did know he was pretty.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Mother’s sick,” she said with bags under her eyes.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“You look sick too,” said Metacomet.  He brushed hair from her face and tilted her chin. “Leave some corn for Squannit.  You need elixir.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Despite her tiredness, Noko laughed. “I wouldn’t trust Squannit to pour me water.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`Metacomet checked over both shoulders, “Don’t say such things.  I’ll check on your mother.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“No!” said Noko, too loud.  She stepped in front of the flap. “She want’s to be alone.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Metacomet grumbled, “No one can take help when they need it.” He shook his head, “Are you coming to the feast.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`She nodded. “We have little to bring.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Sachem will bring more than enough.  See you there.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`His back muscles flexed as he followed the path back toward his camp, always on the move.  Metacomet had met Granny Squannit.  He told the whole village.  Maybe he got better advice.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Metacomet!” She called. He turned. “What did Granny Squannit tell you when you met her.” He was too far, but she thought she saw him flinch.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Uh, erm.  Be kind to others!”  He rubbed his neck.  “I’ll see you tonight!”  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Noko watched him until he disappeared.  Squannit didn’t seem like the kind who wished kindness. `}</p>\n    <p>{`When they were alone, she drug Phillip by the ankles to the pond where he threw up into the water and splashed his face.  He spit at her and tried to strike, but he was to slow, and too weak. Noko left him there and checked back on her mother who was already sipping from the bottle. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“What’s wrong with you?” asked Noko, “What if father came home!”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Your father isn’t coming home Noko,” said her mother.  Tears streaming, “Phillip told me yesterday.” And that was all she said. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Noko screamed at everything.  First at the trees, then at her hands, and at the wind and the sun and the birds. And the white men in boats with their brown water white bread.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Her lungs were empty when Squannit appeared at her ankle. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“And what is all that supposed to do child?” asked Squannit. “If you scream any louder, you’ll chase even the whales away.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Good.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`Squannit frowned, “I screamed like that once, when the thunder stopped.  You know what, more than once. Every time I talked to Mashup I had to scream.  His ears are too far away.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Noko sniffled, wiped her nose, “Did it help?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“No one but me,” said Squannit.  She pulled off one bright orange moccasin and rubbed her foot.  Noko recognized the woven flower—butterfly weed.  “And that was fine by me.” She clapped her hands and pointed to the sky, “But the clouds.  The clouds don’t listen to screams.  They won’t give me the thunder anymore.  The White Man took all the thunder and put them in those sticks.” Through a thick puff of smoke she said to Noko, “Remember child.  When you see your own eyes, let go.”\n/\n“What does that mean”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“You’ll know when you need to.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`Noko shook her head, “How do I find the other gods.  Mashup, to start.  I need answers.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Ask them after you see your own eyes.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`They sat there for awhile together. Noko thought of a question and we she went to ask Squannit she was surprised when she found herself alone. `}</p>\n    <p>{`The feast was set with the finest foods the nation could bring: corn of all colors, geese and ducks roasted to a golden black char, a whole row of rabbits piled high and coated with a sticky brown gravy.  Massasoit himself shouldered a whole seal onto the long tables that had been built by the fire.  Men went to work skinning and cutting the meat into sections to be roasted on sticks. The sun had set early and the stars twinkled and danced over the bay.  The moon was not full, but it was so bright the night seemed to be part-day. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Noko pecked at a small ear of corn and a smaller bit of charred seal.  She was not hungry.  She was watching Metacomet dance and beat a drum with a girl she didn’t like, to a beat she didn’t know.  She finished the corn and threw it over her shoulder.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Mother was dancing with Phillip.  People were staring at them-White and Indian.  Phillip said something and men laughed.  Noko gripped her bow.  She felt, somehow, that they were on the wrong side of a joke. `}</p>\n    <p>{`She picked up a rabbit leg and left, heading back to her wigwam.  It was better to sleep than think.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Her thoughts spun and her mind raced.  But finally she slept.  And her father came to her in her dreams.  He rode on the back of a mighty whale.  She could hear him saying something about `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`thunder`}</em>{`, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`thunder`}</em>{`, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`thunder`}</em>{`.  And in her dreams she wept, for her father would never hear the thunder again.`}</p>\n    <p>{`A rustle woke her and she woke up to see Phillip and her mother.  They disappeared to the other side of the wigwam. She covered her ears and cried some more. `}</p>\n    <p>{`When she woke up again it was dark, and cold, and it was not still.  She heard footsteps outside the flap.  A man’s voice.  Low, but familiar.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Nosh?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Water Runner!” said the man, who was Noko’s father. He had a new tooth on his necklace, the biggest whale tooth shed ever seen.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`She ran and hugged him, tears in her eyes.  Then she remembered…`}</p>\n    <p>{`“You have to go,” she said, trying to force him out of the wigwam.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“But I just got here!” He ruffled her hair with a calloused hand.  And to Noko’s horror, he walked to her mother’s bed. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Phillip was faster than Noko would have thought.  And not as crazy as the night before.  She heard her mother scream, once for joy, the second for fear.  Phillip rolled out of bed with the thunder-stick pointed at her father.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`Her father saw what was happening and he screamed with rage.  “How could you!” He couldn’t draw his knife, Phillip had his own against Mother’s throat. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“They said you were dead!” She wailed, but Phillip pressed the knife harder, enough to draw blood.`}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Liars!`}</em>{` Thought Noko, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`They tell us all lies!`}</em>{` She was silent, so silent Phillip shouldn’t have noticed her grab an arrow. But somehow, Noko was not quiet enough.  Before she could nock an arrow the thunderstruck was pointed at her. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Let her go,” said Noko. Bow caught undrawn below her waist.`}</p>\n    <p>{`They stood there for the longest moment of Noko’s life. Mother was crying, her father was screaming.  Phillip leveled the thunder-stick at her.  She was no more than a foot away from the end. She’d seen it kill a dear, one-crack and it was over.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`The fire crackled in the middle of the wigwam.  So normal amidst such chaos. Could she raise the bow in time?  What would happen with the knife and her mother? Noko stood frozen in fear of the future. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“I’ll kill you,” said Phillip, and Noko knew what he meant this time. `}</p>\n    <p>{`She saw the flame in Phillips eyes.  The bow string was tight and hard against her fingers. She inched it up, so slow Phillip couldn’t notice.`}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`When you see your own eyes, let go.`}</em></p>\n    <p>{` And as she raised the bow, beneath the flame she saw her own eyes looking back at her.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Then the thunder roared. And then bowstring sang. And then Noko and Phillip met the gods. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Far away, deep in the forest, Squannit heard the echos of the thunder.   A tear fell down.  Another thunder death, all because of her.  Tomorrow she’d have to go find that poor girls spirit.  She crept into her wigwam made of maple leaves, took off her orange moccasins, and shit lit a big lump of tobacco.  The White Man was waiting for her. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“This was a bad deal,” said Squannit. Her eyes were red and bloodshot. `}</p>\n    <p>{`The White Man took the pipe and a puff, “But it was the only one in town. Greed. Addiction. I gave you two for one.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`Squannit spit, “They will kill all of my people.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“No they won’t.  They will kill many.  But you’ll get them in the end.  Your people have more strength than you know.” He watched the smoke cloud funnel through the hole in the ceiling, “A single storm might kill ten, twenty.   You’ll see you made the right call in the end.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Then why make the trade.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`The White Man smiled a crooked toothy grin, “Because they brought me here on that boat. Me and that Jesus fella.  And he doesn’t like to deal. So this?”  He pointed around the wigwam, “This was the only game in town.”`}</p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
