In my early twenties I was a big fan of the solo-dolo mindset and shouldering my own burdens. Taking about things does not really help me personally, but writing them down does and others have told me it helps them so I feel inclined to share. `}</p>\n    <p>{`There are no secrets here, I talk about these thoughts with all of those who ask. This is the first time Iâ€™ve committed them to a shareable form.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Also, Iâ€™m no master of any technique.  `}</p>\n    <h2>{`Simple stupid despondence.`}</h2>\n    <p>{`When Iâ€™m at my worst, Iâ€™d describe myself as robotic and cold.  Things seem gray and boring.  Even writing that sentence is boring.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`My symptoms of stress and depression are externally displayed in the following ways:`}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`-Speaking often in groups`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`-Scheduling events more than usual`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`-Checking my schedule manically`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`-Aggression if plans change`}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`Internally I typically feel: `}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`-Disconnected with the present moment`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`-Playing out my life over and over`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`-Unsatisfied with the progress Iâ€™ve made`}</li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\">{`-Angry at myself for feeling this way again. `}</li>\n    </ul>\n    <h2>{`Conditions that lead to my unhappiness`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Meeting people triggers my worst behavior.  When Iâ€™m alone, or in my typical pattern, Iâ€™m not forced to confront the differences between myself and the rest of society.  Rationalizing odd habits as normal is easily one when not forced into any new perspectives. `}</p>\n    <p>{`This week I met several new people.  All of whom who are in one way r another smarter, funnier, or more successful than myself.   I do not lie and say that I donâ€™t get jealous; itâ€™s both impractical and exhausting.  I am jealous, I do envy.  The way I get around these feelings is by avoiding situations that provoke these feelings. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Letâ€™s take a simple example of going out to eat.  On Thursday I went out with the two new colleagues to an Upscale Surf & Turf Restaurant   I inspect the menu, reading the prices first.  After Iâ€™ve established my options, anything priced in the single digits, I then start the mental gymnastics of calculating estimated calories of each meal.  Picking what I eat is usually the combination of cheapest and least satisfying. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Why do I do this?  I ask myself the same question while I watch the others pick what they `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`want to eat`}</em>{` instead of what they feel like they have to. In the end, Iâ€™ve spent more time comparing meals, and choices, and lifestyle decisions the enjoying the company. `}</p>\n    <p>{`And it extends beyond food. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Itâ€™s as though every time I meet someone new, or learn something new about someone, my first pattern is to place myself in comparison to them in some sort of hierarchical arrangement.  You drive a blue car, but I drive a red car so Iâ€™m better than you in this obscure category. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`But the worst part is playing out my lifecycle`}</h2>\n    <p>{`The 1:1 comparisons of `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`things`}</em>{` and `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`stuff`}</em>{` are easier to write off than my bigger issueâ€”the comparison of time. `}</p>\n    <p>{`If I meet someone older than me I go into a loop of what the years of my life will look like in relation to theirs.  Will I buy a house like you?  Will I have two kids?  And on and on. `}</p>\n    <p>{`The next thought is how no matter how different we are, something led us to this same moment in time, and Iâ€™m unhappy in it, so why would I be happy years from now? `}</p>\n    <p>{`Before I continue this soapbox Iâ€™d like to address that on average, I am happy nor do I try to optimize for it. I live well, I feel fulfilled, but every 3-6 months I hit a week of depression where all the above sentiments hold true. `}</p>\n    <blockquote>\n      <p parentName=\"blockquote\">{`To put it in a simply.  Iâ€™m bad at meeting new people and will choose old friends\nover new experiences if I donâ€™t challenge my behavior. `}</p>\n    </blockquote>\n    <h2>{`Four things I do to combat depression.`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Because I am a self-help junkie, Iâ€™ve consumed hours of content telling me how to live my life, or how seemingly happy people live their lives so I can try to emulate it. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Like many people, I some of the advice makes my eyes want to roll.  When I hear someone telling me to `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`honor my feelings`}</em>{`, itâ€™s almost enough to make me want to vomit, or at least leave them a bad Yelp review. Perhaps itâ€™s because I went to public school in the midwest, my anecdotal hippy tolerance is set to default low. `}</p>\n    <p>{`These strategies I hope are not hokey, but a few actionable things that you may enjoy trying. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`1. Add`}</h2>\n    <p>{`This should be thought of as `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Do something that adds.`}</strong>{`  I find that having a project thread between each sundown and sunup helps create continuity in my life.  For me, I write 500 words at least 5 days a week.  These writing snippets are focused in my fiction novel Iâ€™m working on at the time.  This year Iâ€™m close to 130k words written, and although no one has read them, Iâ€™m able to look back and see the forward momentum. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Other tactics related to this strategy are weight loss, weight gain, or other exercise goals.  Whatever you choose as your system of adding, be sure to find the easiest way to track the desired outcome.  Miles ran per week could be written down in your phone.  Itâ€™s an easy way to build a library of results that give yourself your own credibility. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`2. Subtract`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Related to the topic of meeting people, I delete events from my life that are bothering me.  I turn down lunch outings or evening events as they come.  During times of depression, even more so. `}</p>\n    <p>{`I have no FOMO. I love turning things down.  So much so that when I donâ€™t turn something down, itâ€™s a problem.  When Iâ€™m at that happy hour into my first drink, my minds spinning about all the other things I could be doing of fake importance. `}</p>\n    <p>{`My problems arise when I donâ€™t listen to my own advice.  Accepting meetings because they are once in a lifetime opportunity is sometimes necessary.  Meeting new friends that are only in town for a day is a good example.   These sorts of events I do not turn down, and I recognize that they are going to impact my psyche.  During times where many of these events stack together, I focus on maximizing in my other three categories for increasing my well-being. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Remove what you can.  Do what you have to. Prepare for the emotions that come with each.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`3. Multiply`}</h2>\n    <p>{`This is by far the trickiest technique to perfect. `}</p>\n    <p>{`When Iâ€™m feeling small and insignificant, I like to prove to myself that there are ways to amplify my actions outside of my immediate circle. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Some people turn to social media for gratification in this regard.  A simple photo of a well cooked sweet potato can turn into 1000 likes if youâ€™ve cultivated the right following. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Facebook, Instagram, Twitter, Snap, can cause unneeded and negative thought spirals if they are used without control.  Infinite scroll of someone I barely knows profile evokes the same comparison loops that lead to my depression. `}</p>\n    <p>{`However, I think it is important to take advantages of the infinite leverage opportunities the internet provides.  With the proper discipline in posting, or creating something that thousands see, one can realize the overall impact that they can have on the world. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Jesus is one man. The Bible is one book.  But the proper distribution carried the sentiments of his teachings through lifetimes. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`4. Divide`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Extreme focus can lead to incredible production. It also can lead to me building my self-worth into the singular project Iâ€™m working on. `}</p>\n    <p>{`This becomes a big problem when one of those projects fail and I have no backups. `}</p>\n    <p>{`To prevent this catastrophic failure I often have 3-4 main activities Iâ€™m working on at any one time.  Currently these include `}</p>\n    <ul>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><ol parentName=\"li\">\n          <li parentName=\"ol\">{`OpenLoop, the Toptal of Medical Staffing`}</li>\n        </ol></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><ol parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"start\": 2\n        }}>\n          <li parentName=\"ol\">{`My novel *Portugal Wicker and the Fireplaces that Smoke Underwater. `}</li>\n        </ol></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><ol parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"start\": 3\n        }}>\n          <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Training for a 2021 athletic activity (something related to biking or running)`}</li>\n        </ol></li>\n      <li parentName=\"ul\"><ol parentName=\"li\" {...{\n          \"start\": 4\n        }}>\n          <li parentName=\"ol\">{`Growing this journal`}</li>\n        </ol></li>\n    </ul>\n    <p>{`Having redundancy allows me to not feel too much pressure to perform in any one category.  Instead of analysis paralysis, Iâ€™m left with the freedom that comes with knowing I have another pillar stand on. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`I hope this helps one person.`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Actually, I hope it helps more.
