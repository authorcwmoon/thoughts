All of whom who are in one way r another smarter, funnier, or more successful than myself.   I do not lie and say that I don’t get jealous; it’s both impractical and exhausting.  I am jealous, I do envy.  The way I get around these feelings is by avoiding situations that provoke these feelings. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Let’s take a simple example of going out to eat.  On Thursday I went out with the two new colleagues to an Upscale Surf & Turf Restaurant   I inspect the menu, reading the prices first.  After I’ve established my options, anything priced in the single digits, I then start the mental gymnastics of calculating estimated calories of each meal.  Picking what I eat is usually the combination of cheapest and least satisfying. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Why do I do this?  I ask myself the same question while I watch the others pick what they `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`want to eat`}</em>{` instead of what they feel like they have to. In the end, I’ve spent more time comparing meals, and choices, and lifestyle decisions the enjoying the company. `}</p>\n    <p>{`And it extends beyond food. `}</p>\n    <p>{`It’s as though every time I meet someone new, or learn something new about someone, my first pattern is to place myself in comparison to them in some sort of hierarchical arrangement.

Will I buy a house like you?  Will I have two kids?  And on and on. `}</p>\n    <p>{`The next thought is how no matter how different we are, something led us to this same moment in time, and I’m unhappy in it, so why would I be happy years from now? `}</p>\n    <p>{`Before I continue this soapbox I’d like to address that on average, I am happy nor do I try to optimize for it.

When I hear someone telling me to `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`honor my feelings`}</em>{`, it’s almost enough to make me want to vomit, or at least leave them a bad Yelp review. Perhaps it’s because I went to public school in the midwest, my anecdotal hippy tolerance is set to default low. `}</p>\n    <p>{`These strategies I hope are not hokey, but a few actionable things that you may enjoy trying. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`1. Add`}</h2>\n    <p>{`This should be thought of as `}<strong parentName=\"p\">{`Do something that adds.`}</strong>{`  I find that having a project thread between each sundown and sunup helps create continuity in my life.  For me, I write 500 words at least 5 days a week.  These writing snippets are focused in my fiction novel I’m working on at the time.  This year I’m close to 130k words written, and although no one has read them, I’m able to look back and see the forward momentum. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Other tactics related to this strategy are weight loss, weight gain, or other exercise goals.  Whatever you choose as your system of adding, be sure to find the easiest way to track the desired outcome.  Miles ran per week could be written down in your phone.  It’s an easy way to build a library of results that give yourself your own credibility. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`2. Subtract`}</h2>\n    <p>{`Related to the topic of meeting people, I delete events from my life that are bothering me.  I turn down lunch outings or evening events as they come.  During times of depression, even more so. `}</p>\n    <p>{`I have no FOMO. I love turning things down.  So much so that when I don’t turn something down, it’s a problem.  When I’m at that happy hour into my first drink, my minds spinning about all the other things I could be doing of fake importance. `}</p>\n    <p>{`My problems arise when I don’t listen to my own advice.  Accepting meetings because they are once in a lifetime opportunity is sometimes necessary.  Meeting new friends that are only in town for a day is a good example.   These sorts of events I do not turn down, and I recognize that they are going to impact my psyche.  During times where many of these events stack together, I focus on maximizing in my other three categories for increasing my well-being. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Remove what you can.  Do what you have to. Prepare for the emotions that come with each.`}</p>\n    <h2>{`3. Multiply`}</h2>\n    <p>{`This is by far the trickiest technique to perfect. `}</p>\n    <p>{`When I’m feeling small and insignificant, I like to prove to myself that there are ways to amplify my actions outside of my immediate circle. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Some people turn to social media for gratification in this regard.

Infinite scroll of someone I barely knows profile evokes the same comparison loops that lead to my depression. `}</p>\n    <p>{`However, I think it is important to take advantages of the infinite leverage opportunities the internet provides.  With the proper discipline in posting, or creating something that thousands see, one can realize the overall impact that they can have on the world. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Jesus is one man. The Bible is one book.  But the proper distribution carried the sentiments of his teachings through lifetimes. `}</p>\n    <h2>{`4.
