It was gift-wrapped below a tree in his younger brother’s house, maybe in a stocking.  He’d spent the longest year debating if he should send it. `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`It’s for the best. Whose best? Definitely not his best.`}</em>{` Then one evening filled with liqueured eggnog, it had practically mailed itself. He’d spent almost every night since regretting his decision. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard’s brother, Chris, was slow to respond around the holidays due to his shipping empire.  A long time ago—before UPS and Amazon, or even the Pony Express according to company legends—Chris had started the holiday rapid delivery market. He ran his shop with the crooked mind of a mob boss, but with the steady hand of a Fortune 500 CEO. His business was the leader in international delivery, specifically for Christmas. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard had taken a trip with to see Chris’s operation one year and was shocked to find how organized his whole operation was. There were over a million spreadsheets that matched endless packing labels, combined with pages of delivery instructions.  Richard had never been the organized type, he wrote down important notes in journals and checked his to do lists. His max was ten items a day—ten at most! The sheer scale drove Richard so crazy that by ten in the morning he’d switched from coffee to spirits and tried not watch the rest of the mayhem. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Chris had been the favorite child, not because he wasn’t a bad kid, but because he got good grades and could cleverly hide his suspect activities. Richard wasn’t the black sheep, more like the grey sheep—not too terrible, just a little bit disinterested.  He spent a lot of time listening to music too loud and chasing women. His parents had accused him of having a one track mind and being disagreeable.  He disagreed with them not because they were wrong, but because they were his parents and he felt he was supposed to. `}</p>\n    <p>{`He was now thirty-seven and had yet to figure out what he wanted to do with his life. He wasn’t good at memorizing anything and he wasn’t good at being organized either. At some point he’d given up his rock band dreams and taken a  job as what he referred to as a `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`financial advisor`}</em>{`, but most people would refer to as `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`bookie`}</em>{`. Since then, things had gone largely `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`as forecasted`}</em>{`—which he was both proud of and despised at the same time. Take the bets, place the bets, and collect on the losers. If he had found a job he liked, perhaps he wouldn’t have spent time meddling in other peoples business.  Then he wouldn’t have had to write the letter at all. `}</p>\n    <p>{`This sunny Saturday winter morning, Richard was sipping microwaved coffee from the pot he’d made last night. His Christmas tree shone bright in the dim-morning, lights twinkling on unopened presents. It would be another hour before his kids woke up, an hour and a half if he was lucky.  His wife, Shelly, was out running errands thankfully. He’d had trouble keeping a poker face around her lately. That’s why he had to write the letter. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Saturday’s were Richard’s least favorite days. Figuring out what to do was more of a chore than going to work and doing it.  But it was the last Saturday before Christmas. And on Christmas all that would change. `}</p>\n    <p>{`He toasted an English muffin and ate it plain without butter. Mechanically he chewed and sipped. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard didn’t have many friends, which is the nice way of saying Richard had one friend.  His name was James, and he had bought the house next door the day after Richard had moved in.  James was a short old man with a love of collecting trinkets.  His garage was organized in little rows of figurines, and matchbox cars, and balls of all shapes and sizes.  Richard put his coffee in a thermos and headed over knowing he’d find him polishing something or tinkering with something else. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“What can I do you for Ricky,” said James in a withered voice without looking up from the sailboat he was erecting in a bottle. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Morning gramps. Figured I’d stop by, see what you were up to.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`James leaned back, “Usually that means you have something on your mind.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Yah. Got a couple things poking around. Not sure how I feel bout em.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Family problems? Or you lose a bet?” James had a knack for guessing the root of things, he was too old to mince words. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Little bit of both. Little bit of both,” said Richard, leaning against a wall full of antique fishing poles. “I’ve told you how my brother is.  Trying to sort some stuff out with him is all.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“The holidays bring out the worst in people don’t you think? No time like the holidays for family problems.” James shook his head,  “Don’t do anything you’ll regret later.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Try not to,” Richard drank his coffee and chewed on his thoughts, “but what if you can’t avoid it?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`James dusted his hands, “How bad?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard shrugged, “Pretty bad.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Pros?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Peace of mind.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Cons?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Retribution?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`They often had conversations this way, short and direct.  That’s why it was surprising when James broke into a life story.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Have I ever told you why I moved to Florida?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard scratched his beard. He hadn’t realized that James hadn’t always lived in Florida and that there was a time when they weren’t neighbors. “Can’t say you have.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“I moved to get away from family. When I heard there was a job opening here that fit my skills, I took the first flight South outta there.  Cold, miserable place full of little people with big egos.  Leaving was the best thing I ever did.  I stay out of their business, they stay out of my business.” He shook his head, “They `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`used`}</em>{` to stay out of my business.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Why are they in your business now?” asked Richard. He was also thinking that he’d never known James to have a job; he thought he was retired. `}</p>\n    <p>{`James shook his head, “‘Fraid I can’t disclose that information.” He tapped his thigh, “All I know is to be expecting visitors.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard had an awkward feeling that James was mad at him. “Let me know if I can help,” he said, then shuffled back through his yard. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Shelly came back with her hair in a frizz and her arms full of groceries.  Richard saw on the security camera but pretended not to notice. He clicked around the internet and checking sports lines; trying to pass the time—waiting for Christmas.`}</p>\n    <p>{`His phone rang. It was his brother’s number.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Howdy,” said Richard. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Them southern fellas have gotten to you. Howdy.  Har!” said Chris. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Guess so.  Aren’t you supposed to be busy?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Oh, I am, I am.  But I got that letter from you, and I wanted to talk for a minute.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard’s heart drop and his face heated, “You weren’t supposed to open that until Christmas. I told you to wait.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“I know you did. I know you did. But I’ve never been one for surprises.  Listen.” His voice grew serious, “I need you to not talk to Shelly about this.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Not talk to `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`her`}</em>{` about this! You’ve got to be kidding me!  I ought to take her out to pasture.  I told you that! It’s written plain as day what I’m gonna do to her. I’m sorry I brought her into this family. Sorry I did this to you!’ He was choked up and almost sobbing.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Yes, I get all that. I really do. But here’s the thing bud, your story is missing some critical elements. I can’t blame you because you had a lack of insight into certain things, and it’s really impressive what you put together as it stands.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“What are you saying?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“See you have it, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`’Shelly and Gwen are stealing your revenues and pumping them into an offshore bank account. I don’t know how much, but I know it’s a lot.’`}</em>{` That’s a strong accusation of our wives wouldn’t you say?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Not strong enough. It’s more than a lot. It’s a load. A boatload. A treasury load.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Yes, I understand that. Just like they are supposed to.  Now the part I’m worried about is, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`’I’m going to take care of this. Don’t worry, by the time you read this it will be done.’`}</em>{` Could you elaborate on that?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard checked the security camera; Shelly was still in the kitchen, “Rather not.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Richard. I know you’ve always been a little crazy, but whatever you planning is wrong. I can’t say too much over the phone, but do you remember that investment I wanted to make with you?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard thought for a moment, “Clippers?”\n “Yes that one. If you would work with family, I might not be in this mess, but as it stands I had to invest with Deb and Donnie.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Deb and Donnie were the worst bookies Richard had ever met. They gave great odds, but if you lost, they collected hard and fast with big men filled with little hearts. “Double D!” exclaimed Richard, “What were you thinking!?” He checked how the series had ended, “No, no, no.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Sad to say but yes.  It was a tough year, and I needed a pick me up. So you could say I was in dire straights.  So Deb and Donnie came knocking.  I didn’t have much at the time so I sold them a portion of the business.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“And you used my wife and Gwen to hide your earnings from them.” Richard was nodding to himself, this was the type of clever idiocracy his brother was capable of. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“You weren’t actually going to kill her were you?” \nShelly was putting milk in the fridge. Richard touched her on the screen, “Well. I might have.  I guess it’s a good thing you couldn’t wait.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Why wouldn’t you just call me?”`}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Uh oh. That’s a problem,`}</em>{` thought Richard, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`I don’t think he’ll like to hear what else I’ve done.`}</em>{` “Well uhm. I guess I should have.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Mmm.  See I think you didn’t call because you left some things out of that letter.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Nope.  All in there. Hey, Shelly’s home. I gotta go talk to her.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“See I think you might have done something with that money.  What did you do with it Ricky?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard hung up and tried to get his heart to stop hammering. The doorbell rang.  He checked the security camera.  `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`James?`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`His thoughts spun and some things started to click into place. `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`”Have I ever told you why I moved to Florida?”`}</em>{` Richard’s stomach sank, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`“They `}</em>{`used`}<em parentName=\"p\">{` to stay out of my business.”`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`Richard would not have described Chris as a good person. A shady person at best. But he’d never thought his brother to be shady enough to have someone actually spy on his brother. `}</p>\n    <p>{`The doorbell rang again. `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`”All I know is to be expecting visitors.”`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`Richard unlocked his hidden drawer and removed a modified Sig Sauer P320. Then he grabbed a small journal full of everything he needed to know and stuffed it in his pocket.  He picked up his go-bag full of money and passports that he had prepped for situations such as this one. He was a bookie after all. The window screeched as he pulled it open and slung a leg through. His stomach caught on the sill and he cursed himself for getting so out of shape. The monitor showed James and Shelly in the kitchen.  James was inching toward the office. `}</p>\n    <p>{`A clacking sound like a gun being cocked made Richard spin around. Another man, shorter than James but just as old, was a few feet away holding a sawed-off shotgun pointed up to Richard’s chest. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“You look like you’re in a hurry. Why don’t you slow down for a second—Ah ah ah! Put the gun down, that’s right.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard set the pistol in the grass. “You in the family?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Cousin.  But I’m an independent contractor. Not part of the clan.” He spat a streak of brown. “I get paid better this way.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“I’ll pay you double.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`The man clicked a walkie talkie, “You hear that.  You owe me triple now.  That was the deal.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`A static voice came back, “Fine. Just get him.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard knew a couple things.  He knew he was fat an old. He knew that a sawed-off shotgun was good for about 20 yards depending on the spread.  And he knew that if he went with the man he was as good as dead anyway.`}</p>\n    <p>{`So instead of running away, Richard ran right at him. He caught the man in a bear hug and wrestled for the gun.  A blast echoed in his ears and he thought he’d gone deaf for a moment. `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Am I shot?`}</em>{` All of the sudden he was covered in blood from his cheek to his shoulder. `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`I have to be shot.`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`He realized that the body he was wrestling with was no longer wrestling back.  He stood up slowly and checked himself. `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Not dead yet.`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`James was standing in the window with a smoking pistol, “You are an idiot boy.  Now let’s get out of here.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`James’s old Studebaker rumbled and shook down the highway. It was teal green with a figurine of Optimus Prime on the dash. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Not exactly inconspicuous,” said Richard, who was fully hiding in the back seat. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“In plain sight as they say.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard shook his head, “So this whole time then.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`James started back at the beginning, “First I took the job on a lark. Chris asked me to make sure you were safe.  I didn’t think it would be that hard.  He didn’t tell me you were a bookie, and the sort of crowd you run with. Would you believe how many people I’ve had to take off your porch?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard’s eyes were wide.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“More than whatever you’re thinking.”  He went on to tell Richard about every crook, drunkard, and disgruntled better that had been turned away from Muskogee Road. “So that’s a little bit about me Richard.  Now what did you get us into.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard explained how he’d check Shelly’s flight schedule and found a post on instagram from Gwen about how great New York was. “You see,” said Richard, “She never told me she was in New York.  And I know she knows everywhere Gwen goes.”  So he started doing some digging and found a new bank account open in her name.  A bank account that started filling with more and more money. He left out the part about piping the money off to his own account. Then laundering it by placing a handful of bets over the course of many months.  “So I sent him the letter explaining it all.  I thought he should know.”  It took ten exits and as he finished his story, James pulled into a McDonald’s. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Because If this is going to be our last meal,” said James, “I’m damn sure going to get an ice cream cone.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`They both ate their ice cream first, washing it down with a Big Mac chicken nuggets.  James burped and changed lanes on the highway. “What I don’t understand,” he said, “Is how they found out that you found out.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“What do you mean?  I told you.  I sent the letter.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`James looked in the rearview. He dug an envelope out of his breast pocket and held it between two fingers, “This letter?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard was confused, “But how did you?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Im a spy Richard.  I read your mail.”  `}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Of course he did.`}</em>{` Richard took the envelope and read his note.  His writing was plain as day, no changes. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“So tell me Richard. Is there anyone else that could have read this letter?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`He racked his brain. Eggnog, writing, eggnog, writing, heartburn, eggnog, headache, eggnog, eggnog—“What you writing honey?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Nothing!” `}</p>\n    <p>{`He’d said it too fast. She knew he was lying.  Shelly. `}</p>\n    <p>{`And at that moment, he noticed her Black Mercedes humming down the highway behind them.  He’d put a lot of detail into that letter. A lot of detail about killing her. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“But if she knew all this time, why wouldn’t she have gotten me first?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`James pondered, “Do you think she thought she could take it from you? Skip out on her deal with Chris?” He shook his head, “You are truly the worst family I think I’ve ever met.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard was nodding, “I’ll bet you are spot on. She was gonna take the money back from me, blame me, then escape to Barbados or something.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“And I had dinner with Lucifer once,” continued James. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“She couldn’t have gotten to the money though.  I hid I it too well.  It’s spread across a bunch of sports books, and bank accounts, and Bitcoin.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Must be hard to keep that all straight,” said James, without much interest. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“It is,” He tapped his pocket journal proudly, “Had to get organized.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`James nodded, “You are going to need a place to lie low. Stay away from Shelly and Chris. Collect on those accounts and get out of the country—I got just the thing.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`They left the highway and cirss-crossed back country roads lined with Spanish moss and decrepit gas stations.  After a long while, they turned down a half-dirt, half-asphalt road that ended abruptly at a house that was in worse shape than the road. There were cracks in every window, matching holes in every wall. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“What is this place?” asked Richard.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Bug-out shelter.  Better on the inside than out. Come on then.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard did not see how the dirt coated floor and molded ceiling were better than the outside, but it was better than wherever Chris’s gang would take him so he did not complain. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“This way,” said James.  He bumped Richard on his way to the basement door. `}</p>\n    <p>{`The basement was damp and cold with concrete that cried with condensation. It smelled of rotted would and sterilizer. There was a couch, a chair, and a sense of impending collapse. Richard was thinking he’d rather take his chances on the run when he felt something slide around his wrist and clack into place. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“What are you doing!?” yelled Richard. James had handcuffed him to a metal pipe. `}</p>\n    <p>{`James looked apologetic, “I’m sorry Richard.  I’m just doing my job?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“What!  But you killed that guy!?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“That was Petey. He killed my cat back when I lived up North.  Had it coming.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“But, but, but,” he finally got it out, “but why?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`James held up the pocket notebook filled with PIN numbers, access codes, tickets on sports bets set for the next year. Richard’s getaway plan. “Sorry Richard. In my line of work, there isn’t a lot of get rich quick opportunities.  Had to take the chance when I got it.” He pulled out a cell phone with a very long antenna.  It rang twice. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“North Pole Shipping and Delivery. How can we lighten your load this holiday season?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Hey Jess, this is Jim Christmas calling.  Could you tell Mr. Kringle that I’ve located the package and it’s available for pickup at extraction point 442 Waterfowl Lane?” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Thats Loxahatchee right? I hate that place. No one can ever spell it right on the shipping labels.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“That’s the one.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Thanks. The team will be there shortly.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard was left to watch James climb the stairs with his fortune. The fortune that had been stolen from his wife, who stole it from his brother, who hid it from his debt collector.  They really were the worst sort of family.  `}</p>\n    <p>{`“What will happen to me?” asked Richard. `}</p>\n    <p>{`James paused on the middle of the staircase, “I suppose they will get you to come after me if you can convince them that you are to be trusted.  Chris has always been good for finding a liar.” He laughed and said in a mocking voice, “`}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Naughty or nice, naughty or nice.`}</em>{`” James flicked the pages of the journal, “Have a Merry Christmas Kringle.  Good luck catching me.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`Then the short man disappeared up the steps, through the door, and into the bright winter Florida sun.`}</p>\n    <p>{`After a long interrogation where Richard and Chris hashed out their own issues, they made it a pact to find James.  Hints to his whereabouts popped up across the country. An anonymous bidder known as the Toy King started winning almost every auction with a collectible figurine. Antique shops would talk about a little man with a long coat buying out entire shelves of their trinkets. A girl who sold knick-knacks on Miami Beach said a man paid her almost a thousand dollars cash for bracelets and jewelry. `}</p>\n    <p>{`And the day after every Christmas, The Kringle’s received a thank you card signed, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`Clippers in five`}</em>{`. But that’s as close as they ever come to finding James.  They’ll be getting another Christmas Card tomorrow. `}</p>\n    <p>{`There wasn’t any outrunning her car and Richard didn’t see the point in a car chase. They had already killed a man today, drawing more attention to themselves would not be good. He had James pull into a Denny’s and sat down in a booth.  They’d just ordered drinks when Shelly stormed in and took the seat across from them. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“I got you a Diet Coke,” said Richard.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Wheres the money,” said Shelly. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“How long have you known?” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Since you wrote that letter.”\n “So why did you pretend nothing was happening?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`She shrugged, “Didn’t see the point.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Liar,” said Richard pointing a finger, “You thought if I took the money, you could take it back from me and Chris wouldn’t ever suspect you!” He hadn’t thought about that part, James had, but Shelly didn’t need to know that. `}</p>\n    <p>{`She wrinkled her nose, folder her arms, “Were you really going to kill me?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“No,” said Richard, “But I had to make him think I was angry enough to.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`James stirred his coffee, “You are truly the worst family I think I’ve ever met.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard nodded, “You don’t know the half of it.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“So what do we do. I told Chris you had the money. Sent him basically the same letter but left out about the part of you taking the kids and disappearing.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“What did you tell him I was going to do?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Kill me, kill yourself.  Ya know.  The usual.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`James added, “The Satans are a close second.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“We need a plan,” said Richard. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“And I had dinner with Lucifer once,” continued James. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Why is he a part of this?” asked Shelly.`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard looked at the short man drinking his coffee, “He’s been a part all along.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Mmm. Whatever that means,” said Shelly, “Richard. I need that money back. Chris, Gwen and I were going to put it to good use.  You’d be well taken care of of course.”`}</p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
