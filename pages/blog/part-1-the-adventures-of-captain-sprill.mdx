summary: 'Crossroads, narrow roads, and other decisions that involve turning. There are no right turns, but there can be wrong ones. There is a reason navigators were paid royally to help ships cross the Atlantic.  Who is your navigator?'

There are ships in the mouth of the harbor.  The first has a beautiful rich coat of wood stain still fresh from its winter in the bay.  The other ship is older, smaller, with the light gray stain that comes from planks that have been warmed by many suns and cooled by many moons. 

One of those moons was out today, waxing crescent, the last before the new moon.  Sailing by night would be sailing blind.  Stars twinkled and ropes groaned but the wind was quiet.  And the ships were close enough that the captains of each could hear each other without shouting too loud. 

“Ahoy!” young Captain Sprill yelled too loud from the new shining ship, “Where ye be headed!”  He’d heard tales of Captain Geraldo and his crew.  Clever men who knew how to find gold and turn it into even more gold than they found.  Captain Sprill was chasing riches and he was hoping for advice from the sailor not a handful of years older than him. 

“Piece of advice.” said Captain Geraldo. 
Captain Sprill’s ears perked up.  This was it!  
“Don’t say ahoy.  Hello works just fine for me thanks.  Unless of course youre singing, or I don’t hear you the first time.  That was a little much don’t you think?”

Captain Sprill hoped the moonlight covered the red in his cheeks. But then he saw Captain Geraldo was laughing. 

“I’m messing mate!  Jokin!  Don’t look so sad Captain Sprill.”
With a smile Captain Sprill answered, “I didn’t know I’d have the opportunity to embarrass myself in front of my crew so near the start of our journey!” He cast his eyes on the crew members scrubbing planks and tying knots in ropes.  “But if this is the biggest of my blunders.  We’ll have come away unscathed.”  Captain Sprill caught a nod from his First-Mate Yowell. 


“Do you know where you’re headed friend?” asked Captain Geraldo.  His sword hung loose from his belt, his boot laces loose on his feet.  He could have been halfway dressed or halfway to bed from the look of his outfit. 

Captain Sprill pulled on his trousers, neat and tidy, “I’m headed on the course plotted by Richards of the Seventh Province last fall.  With express permission from the citadel he studied the logs of the traitors captured and jailed. His maps show hidden treasure on the remote islands near Morocco.  We’ll return rich men!”  His sailors gave a mighty ‘Here here!’

“Piece of advice,” said Captain Geraldo, “Knowing where you’re going hardly ever works out.  I’d recommend not knowing.” His sailors were nodding their heads on the beat up deck, “Seems to work out better that way.” He kicked off one boot and scratched his foot. “Where are we going again Master Musadiq?” 

A thin black man with eyes and teeth brighter than the white moon answered, “On the long sail to somewhere near the coast of over there.” And then a rising chorus from the rest of the sailors, 'SO WE NEVER GET LOST AND ALWAYS FIND WHAT WE'RE LOOKING FOR!'

Captain Geraldo smiled, “And we’ve never found something we weren’t looking for!” He pulled down the bandana on his forehead and covered his eyes. His smile pulled to his ears. 

Captain Sprill shut his mouth which had fallen open.  This couldn’t be how the legendary Captain Geraldo operated. “Surely there’s more to finding treasure than that!” 

“Surely is!” said Captain Geraldo, still blindfolded, “But I haven’t figured that bit out yet.”
