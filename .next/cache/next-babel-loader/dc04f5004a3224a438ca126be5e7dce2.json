And she knew herself well enough to know that she didn’t just have too many friends, she had too stupid of friends.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Oh Jesus Christ Oz. Do you have some sort of cockbrained resurrection idea?  What are you going to do, find a witch?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“I figure Wanda could do it.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Kora held up a hand, “I cannot handle you right now. Come on. Let’s go to my house. If I’m aiding and abetting then I might as well be able to sleep in my bed.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`000000`}</p>\n    <p>{`They carefully circled Kora’s block until they were sure there wasn’t any cop cars hiding out. Oz was paranoid and he pulled his hood down over his head and shuffled into the side door by the garage. Kora had left it open. The town hadn’t had a break-in in years. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Kora turned the lights on and saw a look of shock in Oz’s eyes.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“What.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`He pointed at Kora, “It’s uh—“`}</p>\n    <p>{`“What?!”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“I think you should look in the mirror.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`There was a moment between seeing herself and recognizing herself that Kora wished would have lasted longer.  Ice blond waves of frizz stuck out at all angles form her scalp. *it will bleach!” She heard Wanda telling her. “It will bleach.” She told the crazy eyed blond in the mirror.  Tired and unwilling, she ran a brush through her hair and tied it back in a bun.  No sense in crying about it. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Oz was sitting at the table with his head in his arms, leg tapping. He’d taken off his ca and his own brown hair was matted down with sweat and grease. He was a mess and wouldn’t be getting better soon. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“There going to be at my house.  We’ll have to wait to they leave. Maybe at night under the full moon.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Kora grabbed a bottle of orange juice from the fridge and poured two glasses, “Easy there psycho. We should consult and expert before planning a resurrection.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Oz looked at her and she saw the desperation in his eyes.  Sunken hollow slits of bloodshot red.  Tears and salt and fire. She handled him his glass of orange juice and he choked it down greedily. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“I’ll get Wanda. We’ll give it a shot.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Kora was that sort of person. The type that would jump off her bridge if it meant saving a friend. She hated that about herself but she was helpless to change it. It was some part of growing up in the midwest. It wasn’t so much a choice as an obligation. `}</p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
