Kora had the wrong amount of friends. Enough that she always had some invite to do something, but not enough that she could get away with not showing up to things.  
 
In fact, Kora believed that the right amount of friends was somewhere between six and eight. In a group that size, two circles would form and she could hang in between both Venn diagrams and avoid any undue social encounters while still being heavily involved from a distance. 

But she had two friends; Wanda was curling her hair, Oz was watching. 

Most of the time they talked about things they thought should happen.  But then things had happened, and they wished they wouldn’t have talked at all. 

“Do you think I should go blonde?” asked Wanda, bouncing a curl in her hand. “Are blondes in or out?”

“In,” said Oz, no hesitation.  His own stark black hair was straight to the shoulder.  

Kora and her friends were townies.  Kora had gone off to Vanderbilt and come back with life experiences she’d paid too much for and a degree in biology that she wasn’t sure she cared about. She was the over-achiever in the group, and she knew she was supposed to trade stories of the lab for juicy town gossip: experiments for divorces, radioactivity for affairs—or, of course, the occasional pregnancy. 

Then, she had traded too much and gotten stuck with a secret.  The worst part of having friends.  And now they were pretending none of it had ever happened.  At least her and Wanda were.  Oz was not one to keep secrets. 

“So we going to talk about the dead kid or no?” Oz leaned  against the wall of the unfinished basement hair salon.  


Wanda tensed and froze, leaving the curling iron in long that Kora could smell her hair burning. “Christ Oz.  Why?  Why do you have to be that way?” 

“Hair Wanda.”

“Whats that?” 

“My hair is burning.”

“Ah! Tiddle-bits,” said Wanda. She threw the curling iron down on the messy counter.  Wanda was the sort of person that was easy to get to know.  She said things like Tiddle-bits and talked about diets like they were religions.  She plucked out a monster cookie from the Tupperware container Kora had brought over and started picking out the M&M’s anxiously. 

Oz was desperately in love with Kora.  She knew because he’d told her one night, stone cold sober under a moon that was too bright.  But she didn’t love him, and they moved on with their lives. He was staring at her with warm blue eyes. It put her on edge.

“Kids die,” said Kora. She shrugged her shoulders, “It was his fault.”

“We might as well have!” said Oz, his neck tensed, a snaky vein rain down his jugular, “We could have done something.”

“Oz.  Get your head together.” Her own head looked crazy, the sides of her hair curled, a long tail covered in aluminum foil trailing down the back.  “You had every right to shoot.  It was dark, you couldn’t see, and people shouldn’t be sneaking around your property at night.” She clapped her hands. “Now, maybe we should have called the police and told him right then, but we all panicked. Yes?  And we buried the body and now we’re stuck in this.  But do you really want Mrs. Maybelle knowing you’re the one that shot little Tony?  I don’t think so.  We made the right decision.  What’s done is done.”

Wanda had moved on from the M&M’s and was plucking out chocolate chips. Crumbs fell onto the concrete.  She sang out, “It’s a tale as old as time.  True as it can be.”

Oz stared at her with a slack jaw, “What is wrong with you?  Both of you?”

“I sing when I’m nervous,” said Wanda. She shoved the rest of the cookie in her mouth and started on the other.

“You two are unbelievable,” his face was red.

 Hotter than squirrels in a wool sock, thought Kora.  She rubbed her toes together in her Dickie’s Arctic Region thermals she’d bought when the first chill set in last week. I wouldn’t mind those squirrels today. She watched Oz’s chest heave. Deep breath, there you go. 

He rubbed the sweat from his head, “I gotta go tell her.  Got to.” He cracked his neck, twisting violently.  Then he slung on his oil stained Carhartt and took off up the stairs. 

“Wait!” said Wanda. But she made no move to stop him. Her cheeks were full. 

Kora tipped her head back and stared at the bulb on a string. “I have too many friends,” she said to the light fixture. Hair streamed down to the floor as she peeled off the cutting cape and set off after Oz. 

“The dye is going to bleach!  Don’t make one mistake bigger!” shouted Wanda. 

Kora didn’t hear her.  And she wasn’t going to make a bigger mistake.  She was just going to make a lot of them.
