I've contemplated starting a blog for three years now and my biggest regret is not starting sooner. When I was first making the decision to bring my thoughts to the internet, I felt overwhelmed by the mounds of publishing options. WordPress, Squarespace, GoDaddy, Oh My! 

After multiple tries, and fails, at starting, I've finally found a format I'm proud to publish on. 

Special thanks to Curtis Olson & Lee Robinson for helping to get this journal started.


# A little bit about me. 

By education I’m a mechanical engineering graduate with minors in aerospace and mathematics.  I attended the University of Missouri where I was a walk-on linebacker and professional bench-rider.  After graduation I went on to become an IT Director at Anheuser-Busch at the brewery headquarters in St. Louis, Missouri. 

I quit my job at the end of last year to found my current company OpenLoop, where we are building the future of medical staffing.  In my spare time I am studying for my master’s degree in Positive Coaching to help lead teams and improve my mental health. 

But I’m more than two paragraphs of work history. I’m a lover, a recluse in the wild, and almost always a little uncomfortable. If you hang around my journal for awhile, you’ll learn a bit more about how I operate.

# What I write. 

I write almost everyday in one form or another. As a health-tech startup founder I'm tasked with communicating our company’s mission and vision to our team and shareholders. But that’s not why I love to write.  I love to write because I suck at talking.  Studying the faces of those around me as I string words together is difficult.  I lose the control of the next thought, the next idea, the next punctuation mark. 

But when I write, I can revise—cut—prune, edit, and speak.  

Some say comparison is the root of all evil, but I really think it’s my tongue.  If I had better shackles I could hold it more often and maybe stay out of the sticky corners it paints me into. 

The top things I write are:

- This journal
- A 100,000 word fantasy novel *Portugal Wicker and the Fireplaces that Smoke Underwater (2022)*
- Media articles for OpenLoop in Health-Tech journals
- Emails, executive summaries, and other business related items. 

## Does all of that seem unrelated?

It is. My default programming has me wired to never like singular things that I’m working on.  Somewhere between a chicken with its head cut off and a dog looking for its next meal, I’m always running from one thing to another.  Or running at multiple things in a very confusing zig-zag. 

My path is not always forward and I’d be lying if I said I always liked the journey.  

It’s fun to look back and rewrite my self history and say that I made good decisions, but I’m 26, what do I know. 

# Will it all come together?

That’s what I ask myself and never find an answer for.  So we’ll all find out together upon reflection.

## Thanks to those who helped me get started. 

Again, this website is only possible through the help of a couple amazing people. Curtis Olson, CTO of OpenLoop, ruined websites for me after building our static site with Gatsby.  I can’t poke around the internet anymore without noticing loading speeds and re-hydration.  

Knowing my site had to be some form of React app, I hunted the internet for tutorials and templates.  My searches all came back to Lee Robinson of [LeeRob.io](www.leerob.io).  His open source library and generous license is what allowed me to build this site.  Thanks Lee and I will “be kind and help others learn.”
