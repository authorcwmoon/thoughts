summary:  “Oh Master Hinchcliffe, dead reckoning is for fools and pirates. Tsk tsk,” he tutted his tongue and trotted in a waddle to the stern, “On my mark!” His hand pointed to the sky.  He threw the wooden chip over and dropped his arm when he heard a splash. Rolling his eyes, Hinchcliffe flipped the sand timer.

Sprill’s parents had not lied about sparing no expense on building *Lioness*.  The ship cut through the early morning waves like a sharp knife through an unsuspecting throat. 

It was a pleasure to steer the ship.  A pleasure that few would ever know.  Sprill gripped the wheel like he’d been taught.  *King spoke up, dead straight to the hull.  Return to position at the earliest.  Steer with your sails and do it with care.* 

Sprill kept his eyes peeled for shiny spots on the wood.  No one would slip on his watch. “Careful now!” He shouted to a man with a roughly hewn beard on his way to the bow, “Slippery when wet!” The man wrinkled his brow and nodded slowly, not used to such orders from his captain. 

He did his best to stay cool and calm.  All the while calculating how much each second they were at sail was costing them.  Sprill’s father had been a master with numbers.  Around the harbor it was known that he could price the worth of a ship's goods by how low it sailed in the water.  A clever businessman, he’d arrive to the best boats with cash in hand before the captain had a chance to shop their wares anywhere else. *“And I did it all with the sweat off my back. No one to help me. I’ve begged, cheated, borrowed—never stolen—from everyone who’s ever spent a shilling in Portsmouth. Son of a farmer!  Would you believe--You have to calculate your chances, Sprill my son. And my biggest bet is on you…”*

Fifty-seven men.  All skilled.  Babes at home, mouths to feed.  A trip that better be worth the price. 

The two most expensive of the men were approaching the wheel now.  Hinchcliffe with his serious brow and tightly lipped expression.  And Sir Charles Dagon. A small portly black man with a vice for a pastries, and tea, and anything else he could shove in his mouth. The best navigators money could rent. 


“Captain Sprill,” said Dagon, pushing back his blue jacket as he bowed.  He kept his teacup in his right hand tilted toward the sky, “Great sailing I must say.  You’ve not spilled a drop of my tea all morning.” 

Hinchcliffe pulled his lip up in a sneer. “And he’s had plenty of it to spill.”

“Morning gents. I trust we’re on course. All set to the coast?” He shielded his eyes as he looked past the rising sun on his left, “South and steady.”

“About that sir,” said Dagon, taking a small loud spurt of tea, “I think you might want to adjust course by a degree.  Take us out of the current a hair.” 

Hinchcliffe rolled his eyes, “And you’d have us believe you’ve memorized the currents from here to Morocco?” 

“Years of experience my friend. Trained by the best. Ignoring the rest!” He laughed and giggled to himself.  A man who liked his own quips. 

Sprill kept his eyes on the horizon.  “You both know best. I trust you’ll come to a decision.  We have little time to spare.”

He listened to the navigators bicker about the best degree at which to turn, and he wondered why his father ever thought it would be a good idea to send two navigators.  *Would have been better off with one reliable chap.  Maybe one with less personality,* thought Sprill. 

After a sizable debate that involved a great deal of cursing and name calling, Hinchcliffe stepped forward.  We’ve come to an agreement. Sprill raised an eyebrow. 

“My decision takes priority on Monday, Wednesday, Friday.  Dagon will have the other days and we’ll split duties on a rotating basis each night.” 

“Grand,” said Sprill, the schedule giving him a headache. “And who’s decision is it now.”

“Tuesday.  So you may turn your degree.” He sneered at Dagon who held up a finger. 

“Not so fast.” He removed a large chip log from his breast pocket.  It was shaped like a rolling pin with twine wound around the barrel and a wooden chip attached to end.  From the other pocket he took an hour glass which he handed to Hinchcliffe. “You do know how this works yes?”

Hinchcliffe looked as grumpy as a groundhog who saw its shadow. “Five knots,” he said, matter-of-fact.

“Oh Master Hinchcliffe, dead reckoning is for fools and pirates. Tsk tsk,” he tutted his tongue and trotted in a waddle to the stern, “On my mark!” His hand pointed to the sky.  He threw the wooden chip over and dropped his arm when he heard a splash. Rolling his eyes, Hinchcliffe flipped the sand timer.

The reel spun out and Dagon counted, “One! Two! Three! Four! Fi-!”

“Time!”

Dagon grabbed the rope keeping his hand clasped firmly on the final position.  He held it up to eye level. “Five point two knots” He nodded, satisfied, “This is how navigation is done Master Hinchcliffe.” With pride he walked the rope back for Sprill to view. 

“Good reckon,” said Sprill. 

Dagon’s face was smug, “You are what you measure!  And we shan’t be measuring bullocks!”

Sprill saw Hinchcliffe roll his eyes so far back he worried they might come full circle. 

“I’ll have to agree with you on that one, Dagon.  We must stay true to the plan if we are to make to the Morocco on schedule.  A fortnight away from the summer solstice.  I fully plan to meet our timeline."

Hinchcliffe was sour, “This incessant measuring will be the death of us.  Some days, you have to measure your bullocks.”  He strode off, back straight and thick neck held high, towards his quarters.
