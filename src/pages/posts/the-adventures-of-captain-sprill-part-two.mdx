Captain Sprill shut his mouth which had fallen open.  This couldn’t be how the legendary Captain Geraldo operated. “Surely there’s more to finding treasure than that!” 

“Surely is!” said Captain Geraldo, still blindfolded, “But I haven’t figured that bit out yet.”  He drew his sword, still blindfolded, almost taking off the hat of Master Musadiq who had prepared to cleverly duck. “Sea ho!” said Captain Geraldo, “To somewhere!”

Captain Sprill watched the boat sink away into the thirsty blackness of the night.  He himself would wait toil morning when they could get a decent reading on the sun and figure out which was was up down, or the way they were headed.  He fingered the note in his pocket, spoken by his father and transcribed by his mother for his father was a sailor who never learned his letters.

*Daniel boy, this boat is our family’s fortune floating.  We’ve found the best craftsmen, materials from the most trusted trade markets, and designs from straight from Shipwright James of the Northern Tide.  Lioness will carry you as far as the end of the world. We owe many people many debts from the building of this vessel.  And don’t get me started on all that sailing school we funded.  We have no doubt you’ll return with twice the price in gold.  Sail swift and stay on course.  Distractions will put us all in an early grave. - James Johannen Sprill*

Then in a short section below. 

*Oh don’t listen to him.  We’ll have tea and biscuits waiting for you when you get back. It’s sailing, not flying.  If fish can swim you’ll be a—
*Whats that!?  Whats that you’re writing!?  I see tea.  I know what tea is!*
*Lords didn’t mean to write that.  Habit.  Your father sometimes. See you soon— your loving mother*

There were a few scribbles around the page, a couple wet spots, tears maybe.

No time to think about them.  Captain Sprill had a crew to run and treasure to find.“Master Hinchcliffe!”  His navigator, a thin man balding with a close cropped goatee, came to stand beside him.  They watched Geraldo sail away. “You sailed with him is that right?”

“Yessir indeed.”

“Is that really how he does things?”

“Captain Geraldo is an interesting man.” said Hinchcliffe, nodding. “His tactics are—Abstract.”

“Do you think we should—“ Captain Sprill paused, tapped his foot, “I don’t know.  Listen to him?”

Hinchcliffe’s eyes grew wide, “There is a reason I *used* to sail with him Captain Sprill.  I’m not sure my heart could take another Geraldo adventure.”

“Did someone say adventure?” said a boy, close at the hem of Hinchcliffe’s trousers.  He was of the age somewhere younger than sixteen and older than eight.  Captain Sprill had never been good at guessing children’s ages so if he didn’t know the boy’s father—the shipmaster who built the planks he was standing on—he wouldn’t have known the boy was fourteen.

His face was youthful, soft and pointed.  His eyes were pulled up with the trace of a smile.  A feature that annoyed Captain Sprill more than it should have.  His name was Carmichael but everyone Called him Carmy for their were both too many Carls and Michaels in the town of Portsmouth. 

“Young master Carmy,” said Sprill, “Finished the evening chores?” 

“Yessir! Finished em yesterday and I’ve already got a start on tomorrow’s” He winked and smiled.  “Are we off!?” 

Sprill could see an eagerness in the boys eyes.  It reminded him not at all of himself.  If it was up to Captain Sprill he would have hired a man to sail the boat, to handle the nasty bits of rowing in and out of harbors, the hot bits of sailing in the sun without any protection, to lash the lines that cut his hands.  But his family had made him a sailor.  So a sailor he was. 

“Close.  But you shouldn’t be so eager Carmichael.  The sea has no soft spot for bright eyes or bushy tails.  We’ll be lucky if we all return.  Lucky if we all return with all of our pieces.” He flexed his hand, remembering the time it was caught between a rope and the dock cleat.  He’d been close to losing his fingers.  He cringed at the memory.  “When dawn breaks we sail.”
