It was gift-wrapped below a tree in his younger brother’s house, maybe in a stocking.  He’d spent the longest year debating if he should send it. It’s for the best. Who’s best? Definitely not his best. Then one evening filled with liqueured eggnog it had practically mailed itself. He’d spent almost every night since regretting his decision. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard’s brother, Chris, was slow to respond around the holidays due to his empire of delivery drivers. Richard had taken a trip with Chris on to see his operation one year and was shocked to find how organized his whole operation was. There were million spreadsheets that matched endless packing labels, combined with pages of delivery instructions. It drove Richard so crazy that by ten in the morning he’d switched from coffee to spirits and tried not watch the rest of the mayhem. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Chris had been the favorite child, not because he wasn’t a bad kid, but because he got good grades and could cleverly hide his suspect activities. Richard wasn’t the black sheep, more like the grey sheep—not too terrible, just a little bit disinterested.  He spent a lot of time listening to music too loud and chasing women. His parents had accused him of having a one track mind and being disagreeable.  He disagreed with them not because they were wrong, but because they were his parents and he felt he was supposed to. `}</p>\n    <p>{`He was now thirty-seven and had yet to figure out what he wanted to do with his life.  At some point he’d given up his rock band dreams and taken a  job as what he referred to as a `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`financial advisor`}</em>{`, but most people would refer to as `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`bookie`}</em>{`. Since then, things had gone largely as forecasted; which he was both proud of and despised at the same time. Take the bets, place the bets, collect on the losers. If he had found a job he liked, perhaps he wouldn’t have spent time meddling in other peoples business.  Then he wouldn’t have had to write the letter at all. `}</p>\n    <p>{`This sunny Saturday winter morning, Richard was sipping microwaved coffee from the pot he’d made last night. His Christmas tree shone bright in the dim-morning, lights twinkling on unopened presents. It would be another hour before his kids woke up, an hour and a half if he was lucky.  His wife, Shelly, was out running errands thankfully. He’d had trouble keeping a poker face around her lately. That’s why he had to write the letter. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Saturday’s were Richard’s least favorite days. Figuring out what to do was more of a chore than going to work and doing it.  But it was the last Saturday before Christmas. And on Christmas all that would change. `}</p>\n    <p>{`He toasted an English muffin and ate it plain without butter. Mechanically he chewed and sipped. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard didn’t have many friends, which is the nice way of saying Richard had one friend.  His name was James and he had bought the house next door the day after Richard had moved in.  James was a short old man with a love of collecting trinkets.  His garage was organized in little rows of figurines, and matchbox cars, and balls of all shapes and sizes.  Richard put his coffee in a thermos and headed over knowing he’d find him polishing something or tinkering with something else. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“What can I do you for Ricky,” said James in a withered voice without looking up from the sailboat he was erecting in a bottle. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Morning gramps. Figured I’d stop by, see what you were up to.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`James leaned back, “Usually that means you have something on your mind.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Yah. Got a couple things poking around. Not sure how I feel bout em.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Family problems? Or you lose a bet?” James had a knack for guessing the root of things, he was too old to mince words. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Little bit of both. Little bit of both,” said Richard, leaning against a wall full of antique fishing poles. “I’ve told you how my brother is.  Trying to sort some stuff out with him is all.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“The holidays bring out the worst in people don’t you think? No time like the holiday’s for family problems.” James shook his head,  “Don’t do anything you’ll regret later.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Try not to.” Richard drank his coffee and chewed on his thoughts. “But what if you can’t avoid it?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`James dusted his hands, “How bad?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard shrugged, “Pretty bad.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Pros?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Peace of mind.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Cons?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Retribution?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`They often had conversations this way, short and direct.  That’s why it was surprising when James broke into a life story.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Have I ever told you why I moved to Florida?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard scratched his beard. He hadn’t realized that James hadn’t always lived in Florida, and that there was a time when they weren’t neighbors. “Can’t say you have.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“I moved to get away from family. When I heard there was a job opening here that fit my skills I took the first flight South outta there.  Cold, miserable place full of little people with big egos.  Leaving was the best thing I ever did.  I stay out of their business, they stay out of my business.” He shook his head, “They `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`used`}</em>{` to stay out of my business.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Why are they in your business now?” asked Richard. He was also thinking that he’d never known James to have a job; he thought he was retired. `}</p>\n    <p>{`James shook his head, “‘Fraid I can’t disclose that information.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard had an awkward feeling that James was mad at him. “Let me know if I can help,” he said, then shuffled back through his yard. `}</p>\n    <p>{`Shelly came back with her hair in a frizz and her arms full of groceries.  Richard saw on thes security camera but pretended not to notice. He clicked around the internet and checking sports lines; trying to pass the time—waiting for Christmas.`}</p>\n    <p>{`His phone rang, his brothers number. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Howdy,” said Richard. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Them southern fellas have gotten to you. Howdy.  Har!” said Chris. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Guess so.  Aren’t you supposed to be busy?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Oh I am I am.  But I got that letter from you and I wanted to talk for a minute.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard’s heart drop and his face heated, “You weren’t supposed to open that until Christmas. I told you to wait.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“I know you did, I know you did, but I’ve never been one for surprises.  Listen.” His voice grew serious, “I need you to not talk to Shelly about this.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Not talk to `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`her`}</em>{` about this! You’ve got to be kidding me!  I ought to take her out to pasture.  I told you that! It’s written plain as day what I’m gonna do to her. I’m sorry I brought her into this family. Sorry I did this to you!’ He was choked up and almost sobbing.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Yes, I get all that. I really do. But here’s the thing bud, your story is missing some critical elements. I can’t blame you because you had a lack of insight into certain things and it’s really impressive what you put together as it stands.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“What are you saying?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“See you have it, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`’Shelly and Gwen are stealing your revenues and pumping them into an offshore bank account. I don’t know how much but I know it’s a lot.’`}</em>{`”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“It’s more than a lot. It’s a load. A boatload. A treasury load.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Yes I understand that. Just like they are supposed to.  Now the part I’m worried about is, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`’I’m going to take care of this. Don’t worry, by the time you read this it will be done.’`}</em>{` Could you elaborate on that?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard checked the security camera; Shelly was still in the kitchen, “Rather not.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Richard. I know you’ve always been a little crazy but whatever you planning is wrong. I can’t say too much over the phone, but do you remember that investment I wanted to make with you?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard thought for a moment, “Clippers?”\n“Yes that one. If you would work with family I might not be in this mess, but as it stands I had to invest with Deb and Donnie.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Double D!  What were you thinking.” Richard checked how the series had ended, “No, no, no.” `}</p>\n    <p>{`“Sad to say but yes.  It was a tough year, and I needed a pick me up. So you could say I was in dire straights.  And Double D wanted to collect.  I didn’t have much at the time so I sold them a portion of the business.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“And you used my wife and Gwen to hide your earnings from Deb and Donnie.” Richard was nodding to himself, this was the type of clever idiocracy is brother was capable of. `}</p>\n    <p>{`“You weren’t actually going to kill her were you?”\nShelly was putting milk in the fridge. Richard touched her on the screen, “Well. I might have.  I guess it’s a good thing you couldn’t wait.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Why wouldn’t you just call me?”`}</p>\n    <p><em parentName=\"p\">{`Uh oh. Thats a problem,`}</em>{` thought Richard, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`I don’t think he’ll like to hear what else I’ve done.`}</em>{` “Well uhm. I guess I should have.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Mmm.  See I think you didn’t call because you left some things out of that letter.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Nope.  All in there. Hey Shelly’s home. I gotta go talk to her.”`}</p>\n    <p>{`“See I think you might have done something with that money.  What did you do with it Ricky?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Richard hung up and tried to get his heart to stop hammering. The doorbell rang.  He checked the security camera.  `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`James?`}</em></p>\n    <p>{`His thoughts spun and some things started to click into place. `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`”Have I ever told you why I moved to Florida?”`}</em>{` Richard’s stomach sank, `}<em parentName=\"p\">{`“They `}</em>{`used`}<em parentName=\"p\">{` to stay out of my business.”`}</em></p>\n    </MDXLayout>;\n}\n\n;\nMDXContent.isMDXComponent = true;"]},"metadata":{},"sourceType":"module"}
