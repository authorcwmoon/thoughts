It’s my birthday! That means sprinkles, MOTM 1-3, corgis, and Taco Bell. This year I’m taking the whole day off because I’m loving me. 

A couple months ago I picked up the book, *Replay* by Ken Grimwood. The premise of the story is the main character relives his life over and over always dying at the same time in his mid forties. The main character spends his first life gambling, the second life getting rich, the third farming in a field in California.

In all his lives, he searches for meaning. Rarely finds it, but he’s happy in a different way each time. It made me question does what I do actually matter?

If it’s not the destination but the journey, I need to program a little more fun in my pit-stops. 

So I’m looking forward to this sprinkle coated birthday, and the next one, and the many more if I’m lucky. And when they stop I want confetti on the casket. 

This post is my public contract with myself regarding some things I’d like to do if I’m continued to be blessed with good health and a stable mind. 

## My future less traveled. 

Some goals that were vague ideas have started to solidify over the last year: 

- Sell a company for +$50M
- Write a New York Times Bestseller
- Write a Screenplay That Gets Produced

These are some public facing goals around achievement. My biggest personal goal is my mission:

	- *Live a beautiful interesting life with few worries and as few things as possible.*


I’ve been changing the way I think about goal achievement. I thought you set a goal, broke it down into little steps, and boom, you’d get there. 

But because these goals are so abstract, I’ve found principles have been more helpful than a process. 

Here are a few of the principles I’m working on. 

## 1. Master something.

All the people I admire most all have a unique mastery of something. Some are business owners, some are writers, others have mastered the art of being a good family member. 

The skill I work on the most is writing. Last year I put 150k words in the bank of my novel, posted a some fun stories on this site, and continue to journal in some form or fashion everyday. 

I love turning a phrase. Absolutely love it. If I get one right I’ll smile to myself all day long. I think in a couple years a few might land in a place where you can see them. 


## 2. Gain some perspective. 

I wlant to be more interesting. I’ve always wanted that I think. When I was younger all I wanted to do was travel. I thought if I was well traveled I would seem more interesting and more people would like me. Weird to say, but truer than fact. 

I still love to travel, but I’m cultivating experience closer to home these days. 

At my job, I’m learning how to build a team. In my home, I’m learning how to train dogs (poorly). In my brain, I’m trying to learn how to be at peace. All these things happen painfully more slowly than a weekend trip to Vegas. But I’m more rewarded when I feel like I’m doing them right. 

## 3. Hangout with interesting people.

Networking. I hate the word. Before this year, I never placed any value on networking. But then I listened to some advice, 

“Don’t network to network. Pick a few people you can see yourself being friends with for a long time.”

This advice is what led me to find my mentor Alec, who introduced me to my cofounder Jon. 

I still get absolutely worn out at networking events. In general, I despise them. But now I have a few things I look for. Primarily, do I find you interesting? These are the sort of traits I gravitate towards:

- Experience - people that have a curiosity about a certain topic. 
- Perspective - applied knowledge unique to a persons life. 
- Ability to articulate

Sound familiar? Of course. These are the things I’m working on because I respect the traits in others. 

## 4. Build my keychain. 

I’ve become obsessed with the idea of unlocking access. I know I want to be a writer. I know I want to be published. What are ways that an outsider can enter a world of fiction publication?

Taking a page out of my favorite author, Neil Gaiman’s book, I’ve found the answer is building a keychain. Gaiman became a journalist in order to speak to authors and publications to learn about what people wanted to read. 

My key is coaching. At my job I coach teams. I am almost finished with my masters in positive coaching. Using this tool of coaching services, I’m able to connect with people I’d otherwise have no access to. 

Excited to see what rooms my new keys unlock this year. And what presents I can bring to those who dwell within them. 

# So happy twenty-seventh spin. 

Maybe it’s the coffee, or the funfetti pancakes Laura just made me for breakfast, but I’m super excited for this year. I’ve got a good gang of people around (like you reading this). A lot of cool problems to solve. A lot of little problems to forget about. 

Hope to see you back here soon.
