Captain Sprill was having a hard time remembering which way was up and what bar he was in. Or for that matter, what island he was on. He had never been a heavy drinker so when he took his first shots of rum, he hadn’t felt anything fast enough and ordered two more. 

His table had picked up in traffic since he’d started drinking. In large part to the the generosity he was showing since his wallet had been loosed. 

“Sprill my Captain,” said Dagon, his white teeth gleaming, “I dare say you look to be having fun.  I don’t think there’s anyone having quite as much fun as you in the whole establishment.”

Sprill answered with Geraldo’s call, ‘*Can’t be lost if you aren’t looking for anything*”

“That’s not quite how it goes,” said Geraldo, sliding in the booth next to him, “But you got the gist well enough.” He smiled a cockeyed grin and pulled Sprill’s captains hat down over his eyes. “We might make a treasure hunter out of you yet.”

“But tonight we are going to sleep,” said Hinchcliffe, responsible as always. “I think we’ve drank enough and we have important business to attend to in the morn.” 

Sprill woke up the next day feeling like his brain had shrunk.  It squeezed and popped while he stared at his untouched cup of tea. Dagon was all smiles. He twirled a key on his finger and slapped it down on the center of the table. 

“Nice job captain. Couldn’t have done it better myself.”

Sprill raised one eyebrow and was greeted with a splitting pain “What did I do exactly? And where is Hinchcliffe? Have him bring me some of that headache powder.” 

Young Carmichael, who was setting the table, snorted.

“What’s that?” 

“Nothing sir. Might need more than headache powder is all. You were quite blootered.”

“Blootered?”

Hinchcliffe entered, proper, tall and polished like he never touched a drink, “It’s how the kids say drunk I believe.”

“And you let that happen?”

“Wouldn’t say I had much of a choice. You were—How do I say—Enjoying yourself.” 

Sprill groaned. He did not enjoy himself.  He’d learned early on that the only way to be successful was to not enjoy yourself. Those who enjoyed themselves fell into the ranks of beggars, or dunces, or prisoners. One slip and he’d be in their boat. Or worse, they would be aboard his. 

Dagon said, “It was the most captainly thing I’ve seen out of you yet. I thought that stick was barbed.” 

“What stick?”

“Inappropriate,” said Hinchcliffe, “We got what we came for and let’s move on.” He held up a bronze skeleton key, “For the treasure.” 

Sprill suspected he was the butt of some joke, he’d not been told of the need for a key.  You could smash a chest open with a hammer if it came to it. Hinchcliffe and Dagon had most likely wanted an excuse to drink. *Can’t blame a man for that I suppose.*

They breakfast on a turbot spiced with white wine and fresh bread bought while they were in port. Sprill thought he’d throw up the fish so he forced down a crusty bite of bread and butter. He could not believe he’d succumbed to sins of the flesh. His mother would not have been proud, nor his father. From this point on he’d stick to the charted plan. No deviation. They were lucky this time and Sprill believed in luck. Luck was like a magnet, it stuck to opposites. Those who seeked luck repulsed it, and those who ignored it found it. He couldn’t count on luck for the next time. 

Hinchcliffe was the special fort of person that could tell what you were feeling even before you did, which is why Sprill wasn’t all that surprised when he said, “Don’t be so hard on yourself captain. There is a time in place for debauchery. We were in both.”

Later that morning after the ship had set sail, Sprill was not happy about what he was seeing in his spyglass. 
“Carmy. Come tell me what you see.” He held out the telescope. 

“Nothing sir,” said Carmichael, squinting into the scope,  “What did you see?”
Sprill thought he’d seen a ship tacking behind them, just out of sight on the horizon. There were pirates in these waters and the pitstop in Gran Canaria had been unplanned. He did not wish to be followed as they made their final approach to the small island denoted on the prized map. His parents were counting on him. The entire crew was counting on his ability to follow the plan. Follow the maps. Take to the island. Find the treasure.  Return home. Simple. “All sail!” he shouted, “Time to make our money.”

A favorable wind met favorable waters and Sprill cruised into an empty harbor on the island that would change his life. The sun was setting and they made the anchor fast, tomorrow they would search for the treasure. 

By candlelight, Sprill fingered the key that had burned a hole in his pocket all day.  Why had they made the stop. Nothing good could come of deviating from the plan. 

But they’d made it to the harbor, and it was a mystery he couldn’t solve tonight. Although he knew he’d find no answers, he tried and he tried, and he fell asleep at his desk, head buried in papers. 

And when he woke up in the secret harbor. It was full of ships.
