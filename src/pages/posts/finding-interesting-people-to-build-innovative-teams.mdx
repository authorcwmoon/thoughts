Hiring great people is the most important factor when predicting a company’s success.  Some people think the key is your secret sauce, your big idea, the vitality that’s going to fuel your rocket-ship. 

Others, like yourself perhaps, believe that the most important asset is the people.  The best showcase of this idea is in sport. Take your favorite sports team, in my case the Kansas City Chiefs.  There are thirty-two teams in the NFL. There is no difference in any of the rules the teams play by.  Eleven players. Sixteen regular season games. Don’t rough the passer.  

But for Kansas City, there is one big difference; his name is Patrick Mahomes. 

Even if you aren’t a football fan, you know who Patrick is. MVP, Super Bowl MVP, records broken, State Farm actor, he does it all. Twenty-four team wins and a Super Bowl championship, it’s impossible to argue the teams success in the past two seasons.

The rest of the roster is filled with other talents that shine in their own specialities. The key was identifying them and securing them a position in the franchise. As a startup founder, that’s your biggest challenge. 

The same way Andy Reid found Patrick, is the way I try to find teammates. 

Find interesting.

Looking at Patrick’s game film from Texas Tech, you can see a quarterback that does things different: whips the sidearm, finds the check down, the things he’s famous for now. All unique techniques manifesting in results. 

When you’re on your thirtieth candidate interview for your next B2B sales rep, it’s hard to figure out who has the right mix of experience and results that will translate to meeting your next sales KPI. 

If you’re like me, you’ve spent hours reading internet articles on the best way to hire. You frame your questions and grade on your STAR rubric.  I think STAR can be useful in framing answers, but you can’t grade on a linear scale if you’re trying to create exponential results. 

My biggest question when hiring is, **“Do I want to spend the next ten years with this person?”**

Interesting people from diverse backgrounds make answering that question easy. They come with new opinions and thoughts that challenge the way we do things. 

Innovation comes from those who are willing to explore the unknown.  If Patrick took three step drops and never scrambled, The Chiefs never would have won the Super Bowl. 

So I search The LinkedIns for the personal blogs, the twitter feeds.  I don’t make a decision off a resume. The real story is often below the CV.
