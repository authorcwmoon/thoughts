It was shaped like a rolling pin with twine wound around the barrel and a wooden chip attached to end.  From the other pocket he took an hour glass which he handed to Hinchcliffe. “You do know how this works yes?”`}</p>\n    <p>{`Hinchcliffe looked as grumpy as a groundhog who saw its shadow. “Five knots,” he said, matter-of-fact.`}</p>\n    <p>{`“Oh Master Hinchcliffe, dead reckoning is for fools and pirates.
