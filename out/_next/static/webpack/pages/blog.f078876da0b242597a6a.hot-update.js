When I was in fifth grade, my partner and I won the science fair by creating a makeshift hovercraft with some wood, plastic, and a leaf blower. That moment sparked my interest into possibly pursuing engineering as a career. Throughout high school, I was exposed to the rapid increase in technology-integrated classrooms and also developed a passion for computers. However, I still wasn’t certain about where my future would take me. Before starting college, I juggled a couple different degree options: Graphic Design (I worked for a t-shirt design company for a bit), Computer Engineering, or Mechanical Engineering (I also loved cars). Due to my extreme loyalty for [Iowa State](https://www.iastate.edu) with sports and their highly renowned Engineering and Design programs, I only went on one college visit.\\\\nNow, I’d heard daunting stories about how many hours the Design program required and how difficult Engineering could be and I’ll be honest I was very nervous. I ended up choosing Computer Engineering because I felt that it gave me the best chance at a job after college and that the field had a strong future. When I arrived on campus, I felt confident I had made the right choice. My first class was Intro to Programming. Our professor asked the class: \\\",\\\"wordCount\\\":1060,\\\"readingTime\\\":{\\\"text\\\":\\\"6 min read\\\",\\\"minutes\\\":5.295,\\\"time\\\":317700,\\\"words\\\":1059},\\\"__resourcePath\\\":\\\"blog/zero-programming-experience-to-three-internships.mdx\\\"}\");//# sourceURL=[module]\n//# sourceMappingURL=data:application/json;charset=utf-8;base64,eyJ2ZXJzaW9uIjozLCJzb3VyY2VzIjpbXSwibmFtZXMiOltdLCJtYXBwaW5ncyI6IiIsImZpbGUiOiIuLy5tZHgtZGF0YS85ZDM2OTM4NmNjMTYwMzk1ZjAzYTljNGY1MjA1ODk1Ni5qc29uLmpzIiwic291cmNlUm9vdCI6IiJ9\n//# sourceURL=webpack-internal:///./.mdx-data/9d369386cc160395f03a9c4f52058956.json\n");
