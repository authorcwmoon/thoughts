The next morning came faster than Kora would have hoped. She’d tossed and turned with dreams of gargoyles, and vampires, and zombies with dirty gray hands sticking up from the dirt. 

Oz was in the kitchen, when he saw her his eyes grew wide with fear. 

“Kora,” he managed, choking on the orange juice he’d poured himself. 

Kora had already seen what Oz was worried about and she as not going to wait for him to say it, “Yes Oz, my hair is a mess. Do you know why? Maybe it’s because I had to chase you all around town and I didn’t have time to rinse out the bleach!? Now pour me a glass of that and quit gawking. Wanda is going to be her soon.”

When Wanda arrived, she made a sad forgiving face. With care, she brushed the fried strands of Kora’s hair, “Oh sweetie,” 

“It’s just hair.” 

“If you say so.”

They sat around the cracked wooden table in Kora’s kitchen living room combination. Oar couldn’t tell if they were staring because of her hair or because they were all afraid of what might happen next. Kora choked down the last slug of her no cold coffee and slapped her legs. 

“Well Oz,” she said, “Do you want to tell Wanda your mighty fine plan here.” 

Oz, bashful said, “I was thinking. You knowWanda. With your skills in the dark magic voodoo and what nt. Maybe, we could um. Plan some sort of.  Resurrection?” 

Wanda stirred her mostly sugar coffee, she reacted as if this was a normal request, something that someone might ask her on a Tuesday when they stepped into the hair salon. Not at all like how a normal person might react, which would, of course, been to have Oz committed. 

Kora knew her friends were weird. And she’d only allowed the two of them to be her friends for precisely that reason.  Again she scolded herself for having too many friends. How much easier would it have been to have only her own problems? The drinking, the pills, the depression. So much easier to manage than the souls of these lunatics. 

Oz and Wanda stared at each other, dead serious. Kora knew that they believed this sort of thing was possible. And despite herself, she wanted to believe as well. She’d never had a reason to think that God or angels existed. But she’d seen Wanda do some things that didn’t have any other explanation.  There’d been this cat. A dead cat, with bones showing and blood smeared across the road.  Wanda had pecked a kiss on its head and it had bounced away happy as the field mouse it had been chasing before it died. 

Kora swore at the time it was all an illusion. A trick of the wind. But when she asked Wanda, she’d been ignored in lieu of the donut Wanda chomped greedily with the cat’s blood still on her lips. 

So maybe, possibly, this resurrection was going to work. 

And that’s how they found themselves breaking into the active crime scene with a basketball, a tub of Vaseline, and a Snickers Bar. 

“We have to be fast,” whispered Wanda. 

“Please,” said Kora, standing over the grave they’d dug only two nights before.
