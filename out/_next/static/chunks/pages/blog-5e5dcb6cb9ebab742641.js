When I was in fifth grade, my partner and I won the science fair by creating a makeshift hovercraft with some wood, plastic, and a leaf blower. That moment sparked my interest into possibly pursuing engineering as a career. Throughout high school, I was exposed to the rapid increase in technology-integrated classrooms and also developed a passion for computers. However, I still wasn\u2019t certain about where my future would take me. Before starting college, I juggled a couple different degree options: Graphic Design (I worked for a t-shirt design company for a bit), Computer Engineering, or Mechanical Engineering (I also loved cars). Due to my extreme loyalty for [Iowa State](https://www.iastate.edu) with sports and their highly renowned Engineering and Design programs, I only went on one college visit.\\nNow, I\u2019d heard daunting stories about how many hours the Design program required and how difficult Engineering could be and I\u2019ll be honest I was very nervous. I ended up choosing Computer Engineering because I felt that it gave me the best chance at a job after college and that the field had a strong future. When I arrived on campus, I felt confident I had made the right choice. My first class was Intro to Programming.
