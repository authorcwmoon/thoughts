When I was in fifth grade, my partner and I won the science fair by creating a makeshift hovercraft with some wood, plastic, and a leaf blower. That moment sparked my interest into possibly pursuing engineering as a career. Throughout high school, I was exposed to the rapid increase in technology-integrated classrooms and also developed a passion for computers. However, I still wasn\u2019t certain about where my future would take me. Before starting college, I juggled a couple different degree options: Graphic Design (I worked for a t-shirt design company for a bit), Computer Engineering, or Mechanical Engineering (I also loved cars).

After the conclusion of my first semester, I was left with a lack-luster GPA and an enormous amount of anxiety heading into the spring semester.

This surge of confidence showed itself in other areas as well. My performance in the classroom improved and my GPA reflected that. I made the Dean\u2019s List twice in a row during my co-op period!
